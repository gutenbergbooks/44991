<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-qi.jpg"
width="60" height="50" alt="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap4"><span class="smcap">"If</span> Lily Norris isn't just the most
provoking child that ever lived!" said Maggie Bradford, indignantly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I b'lieve she just is," assented Bessie.</p>

<p>"Why," said Mrs. Rush, who was that day
making a visit to Maggie's and Bessie's mamma,
"how is this? Lily the most provoking
child that ever lived! I thought Lily was one
of your best friends, and that you were so fond
of her."</p>

<p>"Yes, Aunt May, so we are," said Maggie.
"We're very fond of Lily indeed; she's one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
our dearly beloveds, and we like to have her
with us; but for all that, she's very trying to
our patience."</p>

<p>"Yes," sighed Bessie, "I think she's tryinger
than any child we know; and yet she's
hardly ever naughty,&mdash;really naughty, I mean."</p>

<p>"How does she try you?" asked Mrs. Rush,
though she believed she could herself have
answered as to the cause of complaint.</p>

<p>"She puts off so," said Bessie. "Aunt May,
I think she's the greatest put-offer we ever
saw; and sometimes it makes things so hard
to bear. We try not to be provoked 'cause
we love her so; but sometimes we can't help
being a little. I b'lieve it troubles people
as much as if she was real naughty in some
way."</p>

<p>"Yes, procrastination is a very troublesome
fault," said Mrs. Rush.</p>

<p>"Not a <i>fault</i>, is it, Aunt May?" asked
Maggie. "I thought it was only a habit of
Lily's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"And Lily is a pretty good child," said
Belle Powers. "She is mischievous, and
makes us laugh in school sometimes; but I
b'lieve that is about all the naughty things she
does, and I think that is a pretty good account
for one child."</p>

<p>"Putting off is not being naughty, is it,
Aunt May?" pleaded Bessie, unwilling, even
amid her vexation, to have one of her favorite
playmates thus blamed.</p>

<p>"Well, darling," answered Mrs. Rush, "I
fear that procrastination and a want of punctuality
must be considered as rather serious
faults. I see you are vexed and troubled now;
why, I cannot tell, more than that Lily has
caused it in some way; and I think that any
habit which needlessly tries and irritates other
people can be called nothing less than a fault,
and a bad one, too. What is the matter now?"</p>

<p>"Why," said Bessie, "you see we are all
going to the party at Miss Ashton's this afternoon,
and Lily was to be here at four o'clock
to go with us; and when grandmamma was
going home just now, she said she would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
us all around in her carriage; but Lily was
not here, and we did not like to go without
her, and grandmamma could not wait. But
grandmamma said the carriage should come
back for us, and it has; and mamma says it is
twenty minutes past four, and there Lily has
not come yet, and we don't know what to do,
and we can't help being provoked."</p>

<p>"It is just good enough for her to go, and
leave her to come after by herself," said Belle,
with a pout.</p>

<p>"But you see that would not be so very
polite," said Bessie; "and we have to be <i>that</i>
even if we are pretty provoked."</p>

<p>"I should think people might be punctual
when they're going to a party, anyway," said
Maggie, impatiently. "The idea of being so
wasteful of a party! I never heard of such
foolishness! I should think that people who
couldn't be punctual at parties, and go just
as soon as they are invited, didn't deserve
to go at all."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should think her mother would send
her in time," said Mabel Walton, Belle's
cousin.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose she would," said Maggie;
"but you know she has gone away just now,
and there's no one at home to make Lily think
about the time. Mrs. Norris doesn't have
such a bad habit herself, and she don't like
Lily to have it either. She is always talking
to her about it."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do, Maggie?"
asked Bessie, as she saw her sister take up a
pencil and a bit of paper, and carry them to
Mrs. Rush.</p>

<p>"I am going to ask Aunt May to do a sum
for me," said Maggie. "Aunt May, will you
please do the sum of four times twenty minutes,
and tell me how much it is?"</p>

<p>"I do not want the paper, Maggie," said
Mrs. Rush, smiling as she saw what Maggie
would be at. "Four times twenty minutes
are eighty minutes, or one hour and twenty
minutes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do you want to know that?" asked
Belle.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell Lily a story when she
comes, and let her take lesson by it for herself,"
said Maggie, rather severely; the severity
being intended, however, for the delinquent
Lily, and not for Belle.</p>

<p>"Children," said Mrs. Bradford, coming
into the room just at this moment, "I do not
want you to keep the carriage waiting. Since
Lily is not here you must go without her. It
is long after the time fixed."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, mamma, we know that; I should
think we might," said Maggie, with a sigh of
despair.</p>

<p>"There's the door-bell now," said Bessie,
who was more patient under her afflictions
than the other children. "Maybe that is
Lily."</p>

<p>So it proved; and a moment later Lily was
shown into the room, followed by her nurse.
A chorus of exclamations and reproaches
greeted the little new-comer; but she took
them all with her usual careless good-nature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
though she did look half ashamed, too. Maggie,
alone, mindful of the arrow she held in
reserve, had nothing to say beyond a word
or two of welcome.</p>

<p>"Yes, just what I was saying to Miss Lily,
that the young ladies would be disappointed to
be kept waiting, ma'am," said the nurse, speaking
to Mrs. Bradford; "and I came in to beg
you'd not think it was my fault. I was at Miss
Lily a half-hour before I could coax her to
come and be dressed; and I knew she'd be late
and vex them."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind. You can go now," said
Lily, carelessly. "We'll be time enough."</p>

<p>"Come, let us go now," said Maggie, with
an expression which showed that she by no
means agreed with Lily that it was "time
enough;" and good-by being said to mamma
and Mrs. Rush, she led the way from the room,
followed by the rest of the young party, who
were soon seated snugly in the carriage.</p>

<p>"Lily," said Maggie, as soon as they had
fairly started, "I have a story to tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
about punctuality."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I don't want to hear about your
old punctuality," said Lily. "Everybody just
bothers me 'most to death about being punctual.
Tom has been making a fuss about it just
now."</p>

<p>"But it is a story,&mdash;one of Maggie's stories,"
said Belle, who thought it quite incredible that
any one should decline an opportunity of hearing
one of those interesting and valuable
narratives.</p>

<p>"Let's hear it then," said Lily.</p>

<p>"It is not a story of my own making up,"
said Maggie, with the solemnity which befitted
a teacher of moral lessons; "but it is very
interesting, and may do some good, if people choose
to let it. But as there are 'none so deaf as those
who won't hear,' so I suppose there are none so
hard to teach as those who won't be taught."</p>

<p>"But what is the story?" asked Belle.</p>

<p>"The story is this," answered Maggie.
"Once thirteen ladies went to a meeting, or
ought to go to a meeting. Well, twelve of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
them came at the right time to the house
of a very wise old Quaker lady, where the
meeting was; but the thirteenth lady did
not come for a quarter of an hour after she
ought to. So the other ladies were as tired as
they could be, 'cause they couldn't begin to do
what they had to do without her&mdash;but I
would have if I'd been there&mdash;and some of
them yawned&mdash;which wasn't polite for them
to do, but they could hardly help it&mdash;and some
went to sleep, and some had headaches, and
one who was sitting in a breeze from the window,
where she didn't like to sit, took cold, and had
a sore throat and a toothache, and she had to
go and have her tooth out; which was all the
fault of the unpunctual lady, and I should
think she'd be very much ashamed of herself."</p>

<p>"So should I," said Mabel, as Maggie paused
to take breath.</p>

<p>"What's the rest of the story?" asked
Bessie, impatient of delay in such a thrilling
tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, when she came in," continued Maggie,
giving point to her story by the look she
fixed upon Lily,&mdash;"when she came in, after
doing such a lot of mischief, she didn't seem
to think it was any great harm after all; but
she just said, 'Ladies, I am sorry I kept you
waiting, but it is only a quarter of an hour.'
Then the wise old Quaker lady stood up and
looked very severe at her, and she said, 'Friend,
thee'&mdash;thee is the way Quakers say you&mdash;'Friend,
thee has wasted three hours of time
that did not belong to thee. Here are twelve
of us, and a quarter of an hour for each makes
three hours, and you&mdash;thee, I mean&mdash;had no
right to do it, and thee ought to be ashamed of
yourself.' And the lady was ashamed of herself,
'cause it made her feel horridly to be
talked to that way before so many people; and
she never did so again, which was a great
blessing to every one who knew her, because
she made herself a great inconvenience."</p>

<p>And here Maggie closed her story, which she
had one day lately found in some book or paper,
and had brought it up on this occasion for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Lily's benefit, adding to it sundry embellishments
of her own, which, as she thought, made
it more telling and serviceable.</p>

<p>"But," said Lily, who took the moral to herself
as it was intended she should do, "but
we're not a meeting, and you're not a Quaker
lady, Maggie. It's only a party."</p>

<p>"<i>Only</i> a party!" echoed Maggie, in an
aggrieved tone, which told that this was adding
insult to injury; "she says, 'Only a party'!
Now, Lily, I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but I just want to tell you something."</p>

<p>And Maggie held up the bit of paper on
which she had taken the pains to note down
the sum Mrs. Rush had done for her, lest she
should forget the number of minutes.</p>

<p>"You kept us waiting more than twenty
minutes, Lily. Miss Ashton invited us at four,
and you did not come till twenty minutes after;
and there are four of us besides yourself, so
there's one whole hour, and forty minutes,&mdash;which
is 'most three-quarters of an hour,&mdash;one
whole hour and forty minutes of party wasted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and only twenty minutes of it was your own."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure it's a great deal harder to have
a party wasted than it is a meeting," said Belle.</p>

<p>"I never thought about it," said Lily, by no
means offended, but considerably astonished
at the way in which her short-comings were
brought home to her. "I never thought of
that, and I'm real sorry. I'll never do it
again."</p>

<p>"Did the lady with the toothache ever tell
the late lady she made her have it?" asked
Bessie.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not very sure," said Maggie, not
willing to confess to total ignorance on this
subject; "but I think she did."</p>

<p>"Then she wasn't very kind," said Bessie.
"It would have been kinder if she hadn't
spoken about it. She had lesson enough. I
think that old Quaker lady was pretty cross,
and I'm glad she's not my grandmamma."</p>

<p>"Maggie," said Lily, as the carriage drew
up at Miss Ashton's door, "couldn't you make
me a proverb picture about putting off? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
would like one ever so much."</p>

<p>For Lily took great delight in these same
"proverb pictures," and was very glad to
receive one even when it held up her own failings
to reproof.</p>

<p>"Is there any proverb about putting off?"
asked Belle.</p>

<p>"Yes, to be sure," said Lily. "There's
'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.'"</p>

<p>"Um&mdash;I don't know," said Maggie, doubtful
if this adage were quite applicable to the
case in question. "I don't think that will do;
but if we can't find one, we'll make one, and
draw you a proverb picture about it. I'll ask
mamma if she knows of any that will do."</p>

<p>"And make it for me very soon, will you?"
said Lily, jumping from the carriage with the
assistance of Mrs. Ashton's maid, who had
come to take them out. "I'll try to have it
do me some good."</p>

<p>This was encouraging, and Maggie's imagination
was at once put to work; but not to much
purpose for this evening, since as yet she knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of no proverb that would answer for the object
she had in view.</p>

<p>Our young party was greeted with a chorus
of welcome, not only from Mrs. and Miss
Ashton, but also from the other little girls who
had all arrived before them; for children are
generally punctual to such engagements,
whatever their elders may be. Indeed, they
usually prefer to be before, rather than after
the time.</p>

<p>"How late you came!"</p>

<p>"What kept you?"</p>

<p>"It's more than half-past four!"</p>

<p>"We've been here ever so long."</p>

<p>"We've been waiting for you"&mdash;and such
like exclamations met them on all sides.</p>

<p>"It's my fault," said Lily. "I was not
ready in time, and kept them waiting."</p>

<p>"O Lily!" said Carrie Ransom. "You
always do keep people waiting."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it," said Lily.</p>

<p>"Yes, you can," said Gracie Howard; "at
least, you could if you would do things in time;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
but you never will."</p>

<p>"I'll grow out of it when I'm bigger," said
Lily. "People 'most always cure up their
faults before they're grown up."</p>

<p>"Not if they don't take pains with them when
they're little," said Bessie, solemnly. "Lily, if
you keep on per-cas-ter-nating now, maybe you
won't be able to help it when you're grown up,
and then people will be provoked with you."</p>

<p>"Were you much provoked with me to-day?"
asked Lily.</p>

<p>"Um-m, pretty," said Bessie; "but we're
quite over it now."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't care much then," was Lily's
thought; but she said aloud, "I don't think it
can do much harm when we're little. You see
we're all here now. But I will begin pretty
soon to correct myself of it."</p>

<p>"She had better begin to-day," thought
Bessie; but no more was said on the subject,
and they were all soon engaged in a merry
game of play.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The party passed off pleasantly, so pleasantly
that Maggie found more and more cause for
regret that she and her own particular friends
had been unjustly defrauded, as she considered
it, of so large a portion of it; but she was too
forgiving and good-natured to reproach Lily
any farther, especially as Bessie privately
confided to her that she did not like "that
severe old Quaker lady one bit, and am very
glad that she is not one of my friends."</p>

<p>Maggie thought that perhaps she had been
rather severe herself, and took pains to be especially
agreeable to Lily for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>But perhaps this ready forgetfulness of their
vexation was not the best thing for heedless,
light-hearted Lily. At first she had felt a little
self-reproachful, but when she saw the other
children forget their momentary displeasure,
she thought her own troublesome want of
punctuality did not matter much after all;
they were all glad and happy now, and some
of these days she would try to break herself
of this bad habit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah! you see, that was Lily's way; it was
always "one of these days," "some other
time," "by and by;" and here lay the root of
the trouble which proved so vexatious to those
about her, and very often to herself.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Maggie, as soon as they
reached home, "do you know of any proverb
that would be a good correction of the habit of
putting off, and never being ready in time?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bradford laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think I do, Maggie. What do you
want to do with it?"</p>

<p>"To make a proverb picture for Lily,
mamma; she wants us to. She likes our
proverb pictures very much, and never is provoked
when we give her one. And I think I
shall write her a piece of poetry about it too.
What is the proverb, mamma?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you in the morning, dear."</p>

<p>"Why not to-night, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Because I want you to go to sleep now,
Maggie. If I tell you a proverb to-night, you
will lie awake, turning it over in your mind, and
making verses and pictures for it; and I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
wish you to do that. Wait till morning, dear."</p>

<p>Maggie submitted, like the docile and obedient
little girl she was, though she was disappointed;
for as mamma knew, she would have
liked to spend part of her proper sleeping time
in composing verses, and inventing pictures for
Lily's benefit.</p>

<p>"Shall you make the poetry a divine song,
or a moral poem?" asked Bessie, who took the
greatest possible interest and pride in Maggie's
poetical attempts.</p>

<p>"I think I'll mix the two," said Maggie,
after a little deliberation. "It might be better,
because Lily don't care much to read things
that are <i>very</i> pious; but she needs them a
little. Yes, I'll do that."</p>

<p>And now, according to mamma's orders,
they ceased talking; and Maggie, obeying not
only the letter, but the spirit of her mother's
command, tried to put from her all thought of
the lesson she was to teach Lily, and both
she and Bessie were soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma!"</p>

<p>"Can I trust you to do something
for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, mamma! you know I like to
help you."</p>

<p>"I want it done immediately, dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, mamma, I'm ready. I'll do it right
away."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norris sat at the library table, writing.
As she said the last words she hastily folded
the note she had just finished, and slipped it
into its envelope; then, as she put the address
upon it, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have an appointment to keep, Lily; and
there is Mrs. Bradford now, I believe. I am
going with her, and I would like you to lay
these papers smoothly in my writing-case,
those others in this box,&mdash;you know where they
belong,&mdash;and to put my silver inkstand carefully
in the secretary. There, I have closed it,
so you cannot spill the ink. Will you be a
helpful little girl, and see to that for me, my
daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, mamma," said Lily again.
"I'm glad you let me do it for you. I'll be
very careful with the inkstand."</p>

<p>"And at once, remember, dear," said Mrs.
Norris, rising from her chair. "I do not wish
the inkstand left here on the table, or the
paper to lie scattered about. It will be a great
help to mamma if you do it nicely. Ah!
good afternoon, Mrs. Bradford," as that lady
was shown into the room. "I am all ready,
and will not detain you. I had just received
a note which needed an immediate answer, before
I left home; but it is finished, and I shall
trust Lily to put by my writing materials for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
me."</p>

<p>Lily looked up at Mrs. Bradford, rather
proud of being trusted by her mother; and the
lady smiled as she stooped to kiss her.</p>

<p>"Lily likes to help mamma as well as Maggie
and Bessie do, I see," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes: and she can often be of great assistance
when she is prompt and punctual," said
Mrs. Norris, drawing on her gloves.</p>

<p>"Are Maggie and Bessie well, Mrs. Bradford?"
asked Lily.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear; and they wished me to ask you
to come and see them very soon. I do not know
when they want you to come, for they have
some plans to arrange with their Aunt Annie,
but they will let you know. They are drawing
some pictures for you, I believe, and want to
explain it to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Lily; "they promised me a
proverb picture, and their proverb pictures are
so interesting. I should think any one might be
glad to have them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"They certainly seem to give great satisfaction,
both to themselves, and to those whom
they are intended to benefit," said Mrs. Bradford,
laughing. "Good-by, Lily. The children
will see you soon. I gave them leave to
ask you when they pleased; and you must
come early, whenever that may be."</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," said Lily. "I'll come
just as soon as mamma will let me."</p>

<p>She followed her mother and Mrs. Bradford
to the front door, where the former turned, and
said a little uneasily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lily, attend to the inkstand at once, my
darling."</p>

<p>"I am going to, mamma," answered the
little girl, meaning what she said at the moment,
though she afterwards came so far short
of it, as you shall see.</p>

<p>As the door closed after the two ladies, Lily
caught the notes of a hand-organ in the street;
and running back to the library, she went to
the window to look out for the strolling musician
who carried it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>She had not forgotten her mother's orders,
or the help she had promised to be to her;
and as she passed by the table on her way
to the window, the scattered papers and the
silver inkstand caught her eye, and reminded
her of her promise.</p>

<p>But she did not pause.</p>

<p>"Just a moment; I'll put them away in one
moment," she said to herself. "I'll just look
and see if that organ man is coming here;
'cause I have some pennies in my pocket, and
I'll give him some. Oh, yes! there he is, and
he has a monkey. I like monkey organ men
the best, 'cause the monkeys are so funny.
What a funny fellow! Why, he's 'most the
cunningest monkey I ever saw;" and Lily had
quite forgotten her promise.</p>

<p>She was in great glee over the monkey, who
certainly was a droll, though a very ugly little
beast, as monkeys generally are; and she
amused herself with him for some time, as
he climbed the balcony railings, stoop, and
blinds, hopped up and down the broad stone
steps, and every now and then came close to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the window where she stood, and mouthed and
jabbered away at her. Amused though she
was, she was glad that the glass was between
her and the grinning creature; and she always
took the opportunity of his little excursions
to open the window and quickly thrust out the
pennies, for which he immediately sprang
down, and taking them up in his paw hurried
with them to his master. Lily treated him
also to a cake, which he greedily nibbled; and
then, seeing that the poor creature lapped his
tongue upon a damp spot on the stone pavement,
where a little water had been spilled,
as though he were thirsty, she called a servant
to bring a cup of water, and gave him a
drink.</p>

<p>Finding that she thus provided entertainment
for man and beast, and that he was reaping
quite a harvest, the organ-grinder stayed
for some time; and all the while, the inkstand
remained unheeded on the table. Not quite
forgotten, either; for every now and then the
recollection of it would come to her; but Lily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
kept saying to herself, "In one minute; I'm
going in just one minute."</p>

<p>But the one minute multiplied itself into
twenty before the man moved off with his
organ and his monkey, and Lily felt at leisure
to attend to her mother's wishes.</p>

<p>But it seemed after all that the time had
not yet come.</p>

<p>"Miss Lily," said a servant man, putting
his head in at the library door, "is Master
Tom at home?"</p>

<p>"No, I b'lieve not; I think he didn't come
from school yet," answered Lily, with her hand
on the inkstand.</p>

<p>"I'd like to know what time he'll be in," said
the man, lingering, "for my brother is below
with the puppies Master Tom wanted to see.
There's a gentleman wants to buy both; but
seeing Master Tom had spoken about one if it
suited, he thought it was only fair to bring
them here first, and let him make up his mind.
But the gentleman must know this afternoon.
Wouldn't you like to see 'em, Miss Lily?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
They're such pretty little dogs."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I would," answered the child;
and she followed the man to the basement hall,
where his brother waited with the puppies,&mdash;not
without another thought of her still unperformed
duty; but again she contented
herself with the excuse, "I shan't be half a
minute, and the inkstand is shut up. It can't
spill the ink."</p>

<p>Alas, alas! it was long before the recollection
of it again crossed Lily's mind.</p>

<p>If she had found the monkey bewitching,
what did she find the little dogs,&mdash;playful,
pretty creatures, which seemed delighted with
a playmate frolicsome and mischievous as
themselves?</p>

<p>Then her brother Tom came in; and, hearing
that the dogs were there for his approval,
came down to look at them and decide which
he would have.</p>

<p>Of course Lily must stay and help him to
make his choice; and now that vexatious little
feeling that there was something wrong, some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
duty unfulfilled, had altogether passed away.
Lily was quite at her ease by this time.</p>

<p>The matter was at last settled; the dog
chosen, the man paid and sent away, leaving
the selected puppy in a very low and melancholy
state of mind at the parting. He whined and
cried piteously, first scratching and barking
at the door where his former owner and his
puppy brother had passed out; and at last,
after refusing to be comforted by all the petting
that was lavished upon him, retiring into private
life behind the kitchen coal-scuttle, and resolutely
declining to be coaxed out.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Tom, "he'll be all right
by and by, Lily. Wait till he's hungry, and
he'll come out and be glad enough to make
friends. Now I am going to buy a house for
him. I saw some pretty little dog-houses
down at Bruner's this morning, and I'll go
look at them, and see if they'll answer."</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom! could I go with you?" asked Lily.</p>

<p>"Yes, if you like," said Tom; "I'll be glad
to have you; only make haste to be dressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Lily. Will you go to Nora <i>at once</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said Lily, clapping her hands;
and away she flew to beg her nurse to make
her ready as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Nothing presenting itself just then to take
up her attention, or which looked more attractive
than the promised walk with Tom, she
made no delay, but obeyed his direction to go
and be dressed <i>at once</i>.</p>

<p>How many boys do you think would have
consented as readily, cheerfully, and kindly as
Tom Norris did to such a request from a little
sister? But that was Tom's way. When he
granted a favor or bestowed a kindness, it was
done in a manner which made it seem as if it
were a pleasure to himself. And if he were
obliged to refuse Lily any thing that she asked,
she never grumbled nor fretted, because she
knew well that Tom would grant it if he could,
or if it were best for her to have it. Tom
never said he couldn't be "bothered with girls,"
or "catch me doing it," or ran off with some
other contemptuous or unkind speech, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
boys too often use toward their little sisters.
Tom was a true man, and a true gentleman,
kindly and courteous in his manner and words
toward all women and children, but especially
to his mother and little sister: free, fearless,
and generous; daring to do and to speak the
right; yet so bright, so gay, so manly that not
one among his companions ever thought of
calling him a "Miss Nancy," a "muff," or
other like names.</p>

<p>No, indeed! and was not Tom Norris the
king of Mr. Peters' school, the judge in all
disputes, the one to settle all difficulties, to
"help a fellow out of a scrape"?</p>

<p>Nora would as soon have thought of questioning
her own care and wisdom for Lily as
she would that of "Master Tom."</p>

<p>"Miss Lily's all right, ma'am, she's with
Master Tom," would be answer enough when
there was any inquiry about the little girl;
and it was quite satisfactory to mother or nurse
to know that she was with her brother. No fear
that Lily would come to harm or fall into mischief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with Tom to guard and guide her.</p>

<p>So she made no objection when Lily came
running to her and begged to be dressed to go
out with Tom; and she soon had her ready.</p>

<p>As the little girl went downstairs to join
her brother, he stood in the hall below, putting
on his overcoat.</p>

<p>"Lily," he said, when he saw her, "did you
tell Nora to sew on these two buttons?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom!" cried Lily, clasping her hands
together, and looking ashamed and troubled,
as she well might.</p>

<p>"You told me, Lily," said Tom, "when I
wanted to ask mamma to give the order, that
you would be sure to attend to it, and that
you would go right away and tell Nora. Now
you must wait till I go up and have it done.
You put it off, I suppose, and so forgot it."</p>

<p>Yes, that was just it; more procrastination,
and so forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Tom did not speak angrily, but his voice
was grave, and Lily saw that he was vexed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so sorry," she said to herself, as she
opened the front door, and stood waiting for
her brother upon the stoop. "I did mean to
remember and tell Nora right away, and I only
just stopped to listen to mamma's musical
box for a moment, and so I went and forgot.
It is too mean I do forget so quick."</p>

<p>What was the reason Lily forgot so quickly
and so often?</p>

<p>Because she allowed other things to take her
time and her attention from the duty she
should first attend to.</p>

<p>"Please, dear little lady, to help a poor
woman."</p>

<p>Lily started, and looked around. She had
not seen the woman coming, and she now was
half way up the steps, almost at her elbow.</p>

<p>"Please, little lady," the woman began again;
"I've a little girl at home no bigger nor yourself,
and five more of 'em, and not a mouthful
to eat have they had these twenty-four hours.
A little money to buy bread for 'em, and bless
your beautiful face."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I'm so sorry," said Lily; not
moved by the woman's flattery, but by the
vision of the six children no larger than herself,
who were starving. "I think mamma
would give you lots of things if she were
home, but she is not; or papa either. Couldn't
you come again?"</p>

<p>"And I might go home to find them dying
or dead," whined the old woman, coming
nearer, and trying to peer within the half open
door. "You couldn't give a poor mother a
loaf of bread, or a few pennies, little lady?
I'm not a beggar at all; I'd be ashamed to beg,
but I thought if I could get a lift this once,
I'd work it out some day. I never begged in
my life; but there's the children starving, and
me with a broken arm."</p>

<p>Lily, who was a charitable and generous
child, felt her sympathy strongly roused, and
remembering the store in her money-box upstairs,
she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I have money of my own, and I'll
give you some. But it's way upstairs, so
you'll have to wait a minute till I bring it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
And I'll see if I can have a loaf of bread for
you too."</p>

<p>The woman was about to follow her into the
house; but Lily, recollecting certain charges
she had heard given to the servants, and also
a sad and mortifying thing which had once
happened to Maggie Bradford, would not suffer
her to enter. But, not wishing to hurt the
woman's feelings, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think you'd better wait outside. Mamma
don't like to have strange people come in when
there's no one about; and the servants are all
downstairs 'cept Nora, and she's up. I'll be
back in a minute;" and, with an encouraging
nod to the woman, away she flew on her errand
of kindness.</p>

<p>Poor Lily! in the midst of her intended
prudence, she had been most imprudent; for
she left the door partially open, not wishing to
seem too inhospitable, and never dreaming the
woman would disregard her order, and take
advantage of her absence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>She ran into the nursery and found her
money-box, taking from it twenty-five cents.
Tom was speaking to Nora, who was still busy
with his coat, and Lily did not interrupt him.
But presently he turned to her.</p>

<p>"Going to do some shopping too, Lily?" he
asked, as he saw what she was doing.</p>

<p>"No," said Lily, "this is for a poor woman
downstairs. Don't you want to give her something
too, Tom? And do you think mamma
would let me give her a loaf of bread? She's
not a common beggar: she says she's not; and
she has six children, all starving, just about
as big as me."</p>

<p>"Miss Lily," said Nora, starting up, "now
what have you done with her? Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Oh, you needn't be afraid, Nora," answered
Lily. "I was very careful, and told
her to stay outside, on the stoop, 'cause I remembered
how Maggie let a man come in the
house, and how he stole her papa's new overcoat
while she went upstairs. I took very
good care of her, and told her she couldn't
come in, 'cause every one was upstairs or downstairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
Shall you give her some money? and
can I have the bread, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Wait till I come down and see the woman,"
said Tom, who knew that Lily's sympathies
were too apt to run away with her
judgment.</p>

<p>Lily waited with what patience she might for
a moment or two; but it seemed to her that
Nora's fingers moved very slowly.</p>

<p>"Tom," she said presently, "couldn't you
come and see the woman while Nora finishes the
coat? You know those children must be growing
starveder and starveder every minute."</p>

<p>Tom laughed, but consented; and, taking
her hand, was about to lead her from the room,
when Nora stopped her.</p>

<p>"Miss Lily," she said, "you took away my
large scissors this morning, and I need them
to cut out some work. Will you bring them
to me before you go down again?"</p>

<p>"You find them, please, Nora," answered
Lily. "They're somewhere in my baby-house."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your mamma forbid it," said Nora. "She
told me when you took a thing that way and
kept it, I was to make you bring it back, and
not go and hunt it up for you."</p>

<p>"Just this once," pleaded Lily.</p>

<p>Nora shook her head, though she would
herself willingly have humored the child.</p>

<p>"Your mamma was here, you know, when you
took the scissors," she said, "and she told me
if you did not bring them back as you promised,
I was to send you for them. She said you are
getting too much in the way of thinking that I
am to hunt up all the things you don't put back
in their places, and to see to every thing you
put off and leave undone. You must bring me
the scissors before you go, dear."</p>

<p>"While you find them I'll go down and
talk to your woman with the half-dozen children
all just of your size," said Tom, who
evidently had his doubts on the subject of Lily's
<i>protégée</i>; "and if she seems all right you shall
give her some food; but we won't give her
money till we know more about her. That is
mamma's rule, you know. Nora, please bring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
me the coat when it is done."</p>

<p>And Tom went away, leaving Lily to follow
when she had found the scissors.</p>

<p>It took her some three or four minutes to do
this; for she had left them among a heap of
bits of silk and ribbon with which she had
been playing that morning, and neglecting to
take the scissors back to Nora when she had
finished with them, as she had promised to do,
she had forgotten them altogether, and could
not find them at once.</p>

<p>The coat was ready when she went back to
Nora, and the nurse followed her downstairs
with it.</p>

<p>"Your bird had flown when I came down,
Lil," said Tom, when he saw her.</p>

<p>"Who, the woman? Had she gone away?"
asked Lily.</p>

<p>"Yes, she had gone; no sign of her. But
didn't you say you had shut her out?"</p>

<p>"I told her to stay out, 'cause there was no
one about in this part of the house to take care
of her," answered Lily, with an air of confident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
wisdom and prudence.</p>

<p>"And did you not shut the door?" asked
Tom.</p>

<p>"Not so very tight," said Lily. "I left it a
little scrap open, for fear her feelings would be
hurt, and maybe she might think I wasn't
coming back to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, wise Lily!" said Tom, laughing, as he
put on his overcoat; "you left the door standing
open, and told her there was no one in this
part of the house! Next time, little woman,
close the door."</p>

<p>"Did she come in?" asked Lily. "I told
her she must not."</p>

<p>"No, I believe not," answered Tom; "and
as it is there is no harm done, for I've looked
round, and there's nothing touched. The
hats and coats are all right, and every thing
else seems to be safe. You've had better
luck or a better beggar than poor Maggie;
but next time, puss, don't you leave any one
the chance to walk in when the coast is clear."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're sure there's nothing taken, and
that she's not in the house, Master Tom?"
said prudent Nora.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe it's all safe," said Tom;
"but you'd better call Robert up, and tell him
to make a thorough search. Come, Lily, we'll
be off now."</p>

</div><p class="dropcap4"><span class="smcap">"Lily,"</span> said Tom, as they went down
the street together, "don't you see
what a lot of trouble your habit of
putting off makes for yourself and every one
about you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I should think I did," answered Lily,
with energy. "I'm dreadfully sorry about
your coat, Tom; I really am, dreadfully."</p>

<p>Apparently her remorse did not affect her
spirits much, for, as she spoke, she went skipping
along, swinging her brother's hand back
and forth, and smiling and nodding with glee.</p>

<p>"I was not speaking for myself so much, or
caring about my coat just then," said Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
"That does not matter now; but this is such a
bad habit of yours, Lily, and it is growing
worse and worse."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I'm going to begin to cure myself
very soon," said Lily. "Maggie and Bessie
are going to make me a proverb picture, and
Belle is going to help them; and as soon as I
have it I will improve myself by it. Tom,
why don't the boys in your school make proverb
pictures for each other? I should think they
would. Proverb pictures are so very interesting,
and so improving too, Tom."</p>

<p>"I dare say, when one is willing to be
improved," said Tom; "but I do not think our
boys would care much about them. They are
rather too large for that."</p>

<p>"Dear me! I should think the older people
are the better they'd like them," said Lily;
"'cause they can make them better when
they've learned to draw. I can't make them
very fit to be seen yet; but when I'm grown up
and can draw nicely, I'll make a whole lot; and
when I go to make visits, or my acquaintances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
come to see me, and I see they have faults or
bad habits, I'll just give them a proverb picture
to help them to correct themselves."</p>

<p>"If you don't change your mind in the
mean time," said Tom, merrily. "I don't think
you'll be overrun with visitors if you entertain
them in that fashion, Lily. But," becoming
grave again, "I want you to listen to me, and
seriously, too. You see what trouble this putting
off and never being ready in time makes
for yourself; and you can't help seeing also how
it provokes other people, and good reason, too.
For you know, Lily, you have no <i>right</i> to make
such inconvenience for other people."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said Lily. "I see, Tom, you're like
Maggie's old Quaker lady, cross old thing! I
don't mean you're cross, not one bit; only
you think, like her, that somebody has no right
to take up other people's time by making them
wait."</p>

<p>"What Quaker lady?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>Lily repeated Maggie's story, almost word
for word, as she had told it. Tom was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
much amused, but he did not let Lily see that;
for it was hard to make her talk seriously on
any subject, and he did not wish to have her
see him laugh just now.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, with all the gravity he could
muster, "I am much of the opinion of that
old lady. I do not think that any one has the
right to waste the time of other people, by
keeping them waiting, when it can be avoided;
or by failing to do that which they are expected,
or perhaps have promised, to do. I
know a lady&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's her name?" questioned Lily.</p>

<p>"Never mind her name. I know a lady
who is never ready at the time for which she
makes an engagement, and who in this way
makes herself a nuisance to all who are obliged
to have any business with her; who always
comes into church when the service is half
over; who is late at every meal, either in her
own house, or other people's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily; "and don't you remember,
Tom, how mad papa was that time she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
came to dinner at our house when Mr. Francis
was there; and he and papa had a very important
engagement, and she kept the dinner
waiting so long that they could not get to their
engagement in time; and wasn't papa mad?"</p>

<p>"Not mad exactly," said Tom, "but he was
very much vexed, and with reason; but I see
you know whom I mean, Lily."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, very well indeed; you mean Miss
Lee. She's just too provoking for any thing;
but then I never mean to be like her. Pretty
soon I'm going to begin to correct myself of
putting off, and not being ready in time."</p>

<p>"But why don't you begin now, right off?"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"Would you?" asked Lily, doubtfully. "I
thought I'd wait till I had the proverb
picture."</p>

<p>"Yes, begin to-day, this very minute," said
Tom.</p>

<p>"There's nothing for me to put off just
now," said Lily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"I mean make up your mind; take a resolution
you will begin at once," said Tom. "You
see, Lily, it is the same in every thing. You
always think, 'it is time enough,' or 'another
time will do;' and so the thing is left undone,
or you make some trouble. You are a real
generous, obliging little girl, but you could be
far more helpful if you had not this bad habit.
Mamma often asks you to do some little thing
for her; but if she trusts to you, ten to one&mdash;"</p>

<p>Lily stopped short where she stood, with a
face of the blankest dismay, and interrupted
her brother in a distressed voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Tom!" she said. "I did do <i>such</i> a
thing! Mamma did trust me, and I've done
such a thing, and never did it."</p>

<p>"What is it? What have you done, and
what haven't you done?" asked Tom, rather
at a loss to understand her, as you may imagine
he would be.</p>

<p>"Mamma was just going out with Mrs.
Bradford, when a note came she had to answer
before she went," said Lily; "and she was in
a great hurry, and so she told me to be a help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
to her, and put away all her writing things
very carefully. And I said I would, and she
trusted me, and told me to do it right away,
and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, Tom!"</p>

<p>"And you did not do it," said Tom, gravely.
"You did not do it at once, but put it off, and
so left it undone."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Lily, her eyes filling, and
her voice shaking. "I never did it, and I
should think I <i>was</i> provoking. I should think
the whole world might be provoked with me.
Tom, I ought to go back; but you oughtn't to
be kept for me any longer. You can take me
to our house, and just leave me; and I'll go
right in, and put away mamma's things, and
stay at home for a punishment to myself,
and to make me see how troublesome putting
off is."</p>

<p>"Mamma's things are all put away, Lily,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"Who did it? You?" asked Lily, recovering
her spirits a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. I did not know you had promised to
do it, or I should have spoken to you about it;
but when I was looking round to see if that
beggar woman had been at any mischief, I saw
mamma's writing things lying about over the
table, and her desk open; so I just put every
thing away, and locked the desk. It is all right
now," added Tom, believing it was as he
said. "But how came you to forget mamma's
orders, Lily?"</p>

<p>"It was all the fault of that old monkey,"
said Lily, as her brother led her on. "Horrid
thing! I wish he'd stayed away, and that I
hadn't looked at him, or given him cakes
or pennies or any thing. His frock was awfully
dirty too," she added, forgetting all the
amusement the monkey had afforded her, and
now only disposed to regard him as the cause
of her neglect of her mother's wishes.</p>

<p>"I should not blame the poor monkey if I
were you," said Tom. "How was it? You
went to look at the monkey in place of attending
to mamma's orders, and so forgot all about
them?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily. "I meant to look at him
for only one minute, and then to put away the
things just as mamma told me, but he was so
funny I forgot; and then the puppies came;
and that's the way I never remembered them
at all."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," said Tom, "you should
have put away mamma's things at once, and
then gone to look at the monkey. And it was
your own fault, not the monkey's, Lily. He
did not ask you to come and look at him; it
was your own choice."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Lily, rather meekly for
her.</p>

<p>"Now can't you see it is better for you to
begin at once?" said Tom. "Don't let
Procrastination hinder you here, Lil. The old
fellow don't want himself put down, and will
trump up all manner of excuses to keep his
hold on you. But you root him up just as
quick as you can. Begin this very day; and
the next time you have any thing to do, don't
listen to one of his fine speeches."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, so I will, I b'lieve," said Lily. "I
won't wait for the proverb picture, but just
begin to-day. I wish there would come something
I want to put off, and I wouldn't put it
off, but just do it very quick indeed."</p>

<p>Poor Lily! She was to learn more that day of
the evils of procrastination in her own case.</p>

<p>Tom thought he had said enough to her
now; and they went on together to the store
where he wished to buy his dog-house. Here
they chose one, and here also they purchased
a collar for the puppy, Tom allowing Lily to
pick out a red one, although he would himself
have preferred blue. Was he not a kind
brother?</p>

<p>As they were on their way home, they met
Maggie and Bessie Bradford, with their Aunt
Annie.</p>

<p>Lily rushed forward, letting go her hold on
her brother's hand; and Maggie ran to meet
her, almost as eager as she was.</p>

<p>"Is my proverb picture nearly ready?"
asked Lily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, quite," answered Maggie; "and we
want you to come to our house, so we can explain
it to you. We've just been to your house
to ask you, but you were out, or else you could
have come to take tea with us, if your mamma
had said so. I wonder if she wouldn't just as
lief you should come now. Can't Lily come
with us, Tom?"</p>

<p>Tom had now come up to the little girls,
and so had Miss Annie Stanton and Bessie;
and, after taking off his hat to the young lady,
he answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I think not to-night, Maggie. At least I
do not like to take it upon myself to give her
leave; for she had a bad sore throat yesterday,
and I do not think mamma would like to have
her out in the evening air."</p>

<p>Lily looked as if she were about to cry, and
Maggie and Bessie also looked disappointed.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Bessie, cheering up in
one moment; "it will be just as good if you
come to-morrow and spend the day. Mamma
said we could ask you to do that if you could
not come this afternoon; and we will have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
a longer time, Lily."</p>

<p>"That's putting off, though," said Lily, with
a pout, "and I've just made up my mind not
to do it."</p>

<p>Tom laughed, and so did Miss Annie, both
somewhat amused at Lily's haste to practise
the new virtue as soon as it fell in with her
own wishes; but Maggie and Bessie thought
this a very sensible view of the matter.</p>

<p>"But one may put off a thing when it comes
in the way of a duty, or of another thing
which should be attended to first," said Annie
Stanton. "When mamma's wishes and your
pleasure come in the way of one another,
which should you put first?"</p>

<p>"Why, what mamma wishes, Miss Annie.
I should think I would do what mamma wants
first. Anyway I <i>ought</i> to <i>would</i>" added Lily,
thinking of her shortcomings of that very day.</p>

<p>"Then you see you may put off coming to
Maggie and Bessie till to-morrow, since your
mamma does not wish you to be out at night,"
said Miss Stanton; and with this agreement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the little friends parted.</p>

<p>"I see," said Lily, demurely, but with a
gleam of mischief in her eye,&mdash;"I see people
don't think it is as much harm to put off
things you want to do as it is to put off what
you don't want to do."</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom, smiling, "you see that
is where it is, Lil. We are so apt to think it
will do to put off what we do not care to do
very much,&mdash;any little duty or task; but if
it is some pleasure, we are generally ready
enough to do it at once."</p>

<p>"Maggie thinks I put off pleasures too,"
said Lily. "She was real provoked with me
'cause I kept them waiting to go to the party
the other day."</p>

<p>"Do you like other people to keep you waiting,
Lily?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I don't," said Lily.</p>

<p>"Then ought you not to be careful how you
do it to others?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, Tom, and I don't <i>mean</i> to do
it; but somehow I do. But now you see if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
do not improve myself a good deal of this
habit," said Lily, confidently, yet carelessly;
for it was plainly to be seen that she thought
this vexatious fault of but little consequence.</p>

<p>Lily had meant to confess to her mother
how neglectful she had been of her wishes;
but when she and Tom reached home, they
found with Mrs. Norris a lady who had been
invited to dinner. So Lily thought she would
postpone her confession until by and by, and
not draw upon herself her mother's grave and
reproachful look in the presence of company.</p>

<p>I do not know that she was to blame for
this. Few little girls but would have done the
same, I think; and Lily had no idea that any
mischief or loss had come from her procrastination.</p>

<p>Dinner was over, Tom gone upstairs to prepare
his lessons for to-morrow, and Lily, in her
favorite evening seat,&mdash;that is, perched upon
the arm of her father's chair while he read his
paper,&mdash;was happily playing with some paper
dolls, while mamma and her friend sat opposite,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
talking, when a person came with a message
requiring an immediate answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norris went to her secretary and wrote
the note, using for the purpose an ordinary
inkstand which belonged there; and then said
approvingly to Lily,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My pet, how nicely you put away mamma's
writing things; all the papers in their proper
places and order. Pretty well done for such
a little girl."</p>

<p>"Mamma," said Lily, wishing that she need
not speak before Miss Hamilton, but too honest
to take credit which was not her just due,&mdash;"Mamma,
I did not put them away; it was
Tom. I&mdash;I&mdash;forgot, mamma. I waited to
look at a monkey before I put them away, and
then the puppy came, and Tom took me out;
and I forgot all about your things, and how I
had promised, and never remembered till we
were out in the street; and then Tom told me
he had put them away, but he didn't know you
had told me to do it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>It was all out now; and Lily, as she glanced
at Miss Hamilton, felt as if she could not be
thankful enough to that lady for seeming so
absorbed in the photograph album she was
turning over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norris uttered no word of reproach;
but, as she looked within the well-ordered
secretary, she said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where did Tom put the silver inkstand?
I do not see it."</p>

<p>"I don't know, mamma," answered Lily.
"Is it not there? Tom said he came in here
and saw your things lying on the table, and he
thought you must have forgotten them, so he
put them all away. Shall I go and ask him
what he did with the inkstand?"</p>

<p>"No," said her mother, "I do not wish to
disturb him at his lessons. I will look further."</p>

<p>But further search proved vain, though Mrs.
Norris looked, not only through each nook and
partition of the secretary, but also all over the
room. Still she was not at all disturbed at the
non-appearance of the inkstand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Send up and ask Tom, my dear," said Mr.
Norris.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is not necessary," said his wife.
"He may have put it in some unusual place.
If he took care of it, it is quite safe. He will
be down presently, and I do not care to interrupt
him."</p>

<p>"See what it is to have a good character,
Lily," said her father, passing his arm about
the little figure on the arm of his chair, and
smiling into the rosy mischievous face before
him. "How long before mamma will be able
to put such trust in you, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Oh, very soon, papa; you'll see," said Lily,
confident in the strength of her newly formed
resolution.</p>

<p>It was not long before Tom made good his
mother's words by appearing, his lessons all
ready for the next day, for it happened that he
had not had much to do that evening; and Mrs.
Norris immediately asked him,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What did you do with my silver inkstand,
my boy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did not have it, mamma," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"But you put it away this afternoon, did
you not?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Tom, wonderingly, but
positively.</p>

<p>"Why, yes, Tom," said Lily, "you told me
you had put away all mamma's things that
she left on the table."</p>

<p>"But there was no inkstand there," said
Tom. "I remember noticing that, because I
said to myself, 'Mamma has taken time to put
by her ink;' and I supposed you had feared it
would be spilled, mamma. There was no
inkstand upon the table, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Did you move the inkstand at all, Lily?"
asked Mrs. Norris.</p>

<p>"No, mamma, I never touched it. I did
not put away one single thing."</p>

<p>Tom helped his mother in a fresh search for
the missing inkstand; but all in vain.</p>

<p>Then the servant man was called, and questioned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"I saw Miss Lily with her hand on the inkstand
when I called her to see the little dogs
this afternoon, ma'am," he said, in reply to
Mrs. Norris's inquiries. "Do you remember,
if you please, Miss Lily?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Lily. "I remember now,
mamma. I did take it up to put it away, but
I set it down again when I ran after Robert to
see the puppies. I meant to come right back,
but I never thought of it again."</p>

<p>"Master Tom," said Robert, "you were asking
me had I seen a beggar-woman about the door
this afternoon. Could she have been in here,
and caught up the inkstand? If she'd just
opened the library door, and peeped in, it would
have been the first thing she'd see, for it stood
right here, where Miss Lily left it."</p>

<p>Tom looked dismayed, and Lily still more
so; for, if the inkstand were indeed stolen, was
it not all her fault? Owing to her procrastination,
to the putting off of the small service her
mother had asked of her? And so it proved;
for nothing could be found of the inkstand,
and it was never heard of again. Its loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
could be accounted for in no other way than by
supposing that the woman, finding the door
left open, and learning from Lily's imprudent
words that there was no one about to interfere
with her, had walked in, opened the library
door, and seeing the inkstand, had snatched it
up, and made off with it.</p>

<p>Lily's shame and grief were very great, all
the more so because she knew that this inkstand
was dearly loved and valued by her
mamma, because it had been the gift of a dead
sister. And seeing this, her mother could not
bear to reproach her, for it was very unusual
for Lily to take her own wrong-doing much to
heart. But this was, as she said herself, "the
worst consequence I ever did in all my long
life;" and she probably felt it all the more
deeply for her kind mother's forbearance.</p>

<p>That she was sufficiently punished by her
own remorse was plainly to be seen; and long
after she was in bed and fast asleep, her
mother heard long sobs heaving her little
breast, and found her pillow all wet with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
tears.</p>

<p>"My poor little one! I hope it may be a
lasting lesson to her," said the mother, as she
pushed back the hair from the flushed and
tear-stained face. "If it should be, I shall
think it cheaply purchased even by the loss of
my much valued inkstand."</p>

</div><p class="dropcap2"><span class="smcap">Lily</span> was still in a very subdued and
melancholy frame of mind when she
reached the Bradfords' house on the
following day; and when her little playmates
inquired the cause, she made answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If mamma had given me my deservings,
she would have shut me up in a room by myself,
and never let me come out in all my life,
nor come to spend the day with you any more.
It's a great deal too good for such a sinner as
me, and something ought to be done to me. I
don't mean to have a nice time to-day."</p>

<p>This virtuous resolution was forgotten, however,
before the day was over; but at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it much astonished her young friends, as did
also the low state of Lily's spirits.</p>

<p>Fresh questions followed; and Lily told her
story, mingling her own bitter self-accusations
with reproaches against the supposed thief.</p>

<p>"For I told her she was not to come in,
'cause there was no one about to 'tend to her,"
she said, as if this were an added aggravation
of her sorrows; "and I only left the door open
for fear her feelings would be hurt; but now I
don't b'lieve she had any to hurt. I don't
s'pose thieves have many feelings, do you, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe they have," answered
Maggie. "I just expect their feelings are
'lost to sight, and not to memory dear.'"</p>

<p>This fine sentiment, having been properly
appreciated, called up the recollection of the
promised proverb picture.</p>

<p>"Did you find a proverb that would be a
lesson for me, or did you have to make one?"
asked mournful Lily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma told us one," said Maggie. "It
is 'Procrastination is the thief of Time.'"</p>

<p>"You'd better say the thief of inkstands,"
said Lily, ruefully. "Maggie and Bessie and
Belle, I feel 'most as if it was me who had
stolen mamma's inkstand."</p>

<p>The other little girls all set about consoling
her; and Bessie took an opportunity to whisper
to Maggie that she thought they had better
not give Lily the proverb picture that day because
it might make her feel worse.</p>

<p>But this was not by any means Lily's view
of the matter; and she presently asked to be
shown this joint production of her three little
friends, Maggie and Bessie and Belle.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the picture, or rather pictures,
were brought forth, and with them the poem
which Maggie had composed to accompany
them.</p>

<p>When the red ribbon which tied the first
was taken off, and the pictures unrolled, they
proved quite a panorama; and Lily's mournful
face lighted up at the sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"How good of you!" she said. "It must
have taken you ever so long to draw all those
pictures."</p>

<p>"There are four of them," said Bessie.
"Belle made two, 'cause she can draw the
best, and Maggie made one, and I one; but
Maggie made 'most all the ideas. I think
they're so very plain you can make them out
for yourself, Lily, but we'll 'splain them to you
if you like."</p>

<p>"I'll see how much I can find out, and you
can tell me the rest," said Lily, setting herself
at once to the study of the drawings.</p>

<p>"What's the reading on this one?" she
asked. "P-r-o-pro-c-r-a-s-cras&mdash;Oh! I s'pose
this is 'Procrastination is the thief of Time.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie.</p>

<p>"And this is a skeleton," said Lily, "a
skeleton with a goblet in one hand, and a&mdash;and
a"&mdash;Lily hesitated, wishing to be sure to
hit the right nail on the head&mdash;"and a&mdash;I'm
not quite sure if it's a feather dust-brush, or a
coachman's whip."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Belle, indignant.</p>

<p>"Why, Lily!" said Bessie, "that's Time with
his hour-glass and scythe, and Belle drew that
picture, and we think it's the very best one of
all."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Lily, rather ashamed of
not having at once recognized the articles in
question.</p>

<p>"You know in the pictures Time is always
a very thin old man," said Bessie, "so we had
to make him so to have it real; and Maggie
told Belle she'd better make him as thin as
she could, 'cause that horrid thief Procrastination
bothers him so he hardly has any flesh
on his bones. This is a kind of allegory picture,
you see, Lily."</p>

<p>"Yes, I understand. And this rather beggar-looking
child&mdash;" Lily hesitated again,
unwilling to run the risk of making any more
such uncomplimentary mistakes. "I think
you'd better tell me about it. I'm 'fraid I'm
rather stupid this morning. I think I went
crazy last night about that inkstand, and I'm
hardly recovered yet. I b'lieve that's the reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
I didn't know Time's hour-glass and scythe
at first."</p>

<p>Never before had her little friends known
Lily to speak and look with such solemnity,
and they all felt very much for her.</p>

<p>Maggie, however, thought it well to improve
the occasion.</p>

<p>"I did not want to seem severe with her,"
she said afterward to Bessie and Belle, "but
I thought the picture might make a deeper
impression if I let her see to what a dreadful
condition procrastinating people might come."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said to Lily, "yes, that is
Procrastination, all ragged and dirty and starved.
He never has a nice time, and he hardly
ever has any thing to eat, 'cause when people
say to him, 'Procrastination, dinner is ready,'
he says, 'I think I'll eat by and by;' and then
when he comes, the dinner is all gone, and he
has to go hungry: and when they say, 'Go
and get washed, and have on clean clothes,'
he says, 'Another day I will;' so he becomes
all ragged, and his friends are so ashamed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
him that they just let him take care of himself.
That's the way he looks so horridly. And
poor old Time hardly knows what to do with
himself for the way that troublesome fellow
worries him. He doesn't leave Time
alone to do his duty one minute. Do you see
these things in Procrastination's hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what are they?" asked Lily, deeply
interested.</p>

<p>"They are Time's purse and pocket handkerchief
that Procrastination&mdash;I think we'd
better call him Pro, because it takes so long to
say Procrastination&mdash;that Pro has stolen
out of his pocket; and here at his feet are
some broken hour-glasses; and now he is running
after Time, and trying to steal his last
hour-glass, so that the poor old fellow will have
none left. That means, when you're not talking
allegory, that Pro steals the hours and
makes you lose all your time; but he can not
catch him up, which means that when you have
lost your time, you never can catch up with it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily, dolefully; "but I think it
would be better if you made Pro stealing inkstands.
It's just what I deserve. Is that all
about that picture?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Maggie; "now we come to
real life. Bessie, this is your picture; tell
Lily about it."</p>

<p>It is to be observed that the ragged figure
which represented Procrastination, or "Pro,"
was to be seen in each successive picture.
This was considered a judicious mingling of
the allegorical with reality.</p>

<p>"This," said Bessie, "is a little girl whose
mamma said to her, 'My dear, there is a
match upon the carpet; pick it up right
away.' But Procrastination"&mdash;Bessie would
not on any account have shortened her words,
especially on such a grave occasion&mdash;"came
and whispered to her, 'By and by will do;
it's time enough;' and presently her little
sister came in and picked up the match,
and set herself on fire, and she was quite
burnt up before she could be put out, and she
was the only sister the put-offing child had,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and she stayed unhappy all the rest of the
days of her life."</p>

<p>"Like me," said Lily.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Maggie, cheerfully, "you'll
get over that inkstand. I find people generally
do get over things; at least, I do. Take
courage by me, Lily. I thought I never should
recover having papa's coat stolen, but you see
I have; and I think I'm about as happy as any
child could be."</p>

<p>"Ah! but you wasn't disobedient, and didn't
put off," said Lily. "Tell me some more."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we'd better not, 'cause you feel
so badly," said Bessie.</p>

<p>"They do me good," answered Lily. "I
don't think I can care for any thing else to-day.
Who made this picture?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Maggie, "and this is the story
of it. This is fable or allegory too;" and,
unrolling another sheet of paper, Maggie read
aloud her famous poem, which had been pronounced
a great success by both Bessie and
Belle. Her picture consisted of a series of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
small drawings, which explained themselves
as she read the verses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>In the ears of the little listeners this was a
perfect gem of poetry, far beyond any thing
Maggie had ever written before, whether it
were "divine song," or "moral poem." The
concluding lines were considered particularly
fine, and, indeed, had been added on account of
their striking effect.</p>

<p>Bessie and Belle had heard it before, but
they listened with rapt attention, and Lily was
very much impressed. The third verse she felt
particularly adapted to her case, though Maggie
had intended no home thrust when she wrote
it. But, to Lily's mind, it just suited the affair
of the inkstand; and when Maggie finished
reading, she exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I should think I <i>was</i> a base, heartless
crime!"</p>

<p>The children all hastened to console her,
and to assure her that they thought she would
not fail to improve, now that she saw her fault
so plainly.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean that the child in the poem
was really you," said Maggie. "That's the
reason I made Pro a boy instead of a girl. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
only wanted to show you what people might
come to who procrastinated all the time, and
never were punctual."</p>

<p>Maggie's drawing, as you have heard, was
divided up into a number of smaller pictures,
each one suited to a particular verse of the
poem; and they explained themselves to one
who had read or heard the latter.</p>

<p>The fourth and last picture had been drawn
by Belle, the chief artist among the little party.</p>

<p>This also represented Father Time, who had
now grown fat and flourishing, which was
somewhat singular under the circumstances.
He was accompanied by another burly figure,
and both were armed with many lashes and
whips with which they chased "Pro," now
himself reduced to a skeleton state, and vainly
endeavoring to escape from his tormentors.</p>

<p>"This," said Belle, "is my drawing, but it
is Maggie's idea, and Bessie and I think it is
pretty grand. Here is that naughty Pro, and
he has lost every thing and every one he had
in the world, all through his own putting off;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and here," pointing to little dots and round <i>o</i>'s
with which the page was covered, "here are
the hours and minutes flying away from him
too. The largest ones are the hours; the
little ones, the minutes. And here are Father
Time and Remorse coming after him with
their&mdash;their&mdash;What kind of whips do they
have, Maggie?"</p>

<p>"<i>Scorpion</i> whips," answered Maggie. "It
was a very convenient thing that I happened
to read the other day about the 'scorpion whip
of Remorse,' and it just gave me the idea for
this picture. It means that when we feel very
badly about something we know we deserve, it
is just as bad as the stings of scorpions and
bugs and other horrid things. And I thought
we'd make believe Remorse had two scorpion
whips, and lent one to Time to chase Procrastination
with."</p>

<p>"Here's the ocean," said Belle, directing
Lily's attention to where high, curling waves
were supposed to be leaping and dashing
upward, "and Pro was running away so fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
from those dreadful scorpion whips that he
never saw it, but ran right into the water, and
was drowned; and that was the end of <i>him</i>."</p>

<p>Belle's tone was very triumphant when she
uttered the last word, as though she were glad
to have thus disposed of a troublesome customer.</p>

<p>"I'm sure," said Lily, with an air of melancholy
satisfaction, "I'm sure I'm very much
obliged to you all for taking so much trouble
to improve me; and I don't see how I can help
being better now."</p>

<p>"Then that's all we ask," said Maggie,
"and we shan't regret any trouble we took.
Now let's go and play."</p>

<p>If the other children had had any fears that
Lily's remorse and the "lesson" they had
given her would interfere with her enjoyment
of the day, such fears were soon put to flight;
for in ten minutes she was as merry and
roguish as ever, and quite disposed to join in
all the entertainment provided for her.</p>

</div><p class="dropcap1"><span class="smcap">"How</span> many of my little girls would
like to help in a good work?"
asked Miss Ashton, some two or
three days after this.</p>

<p>Ten little hands went up. Ten? Nay, I
think there were thirteen or fourteen; for some
of the children were not content with holding
up one, but raised both in their zeal to show
Miss Ashton they were ready to do what she
asked.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton went on to explain.</p>

<p>"I think you will all remember," she said,
"the lame soldier who was run over and killed
on the corner of this street?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a murmur of assenting voices,
and little Belle added,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Papa said it was a very generous thing for
you and Mrs. Ashton to take care of his three
children, Miss Ashton; and I think so too."</p>

<p>Miss Ashton smiled at her, and continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But we could not take care of them always,
dear Belle, and through the kindness of some
friends we have found a pleasant home in the
country for them. It is necessary that they
should be comfortably fitted out before we send
them there, however, and my uncle says that he
will provide all the materials that the school
will make up. The young ladies in my mother's
room say they will make all the dresses and
more difficult garments, and leave the simple
and easier ones for you, if you choose to help.
But before you make any promises, I wish you
to ask your parents' permission, and also to
make up your minds to have the garment you
take finished by the end of two weeks, when
the children are to leave for their new home.
You nearly all sew well enough to do the easy
work upon these little skirts and aprons, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
think your friends at home will give you what
help you may need."</p>

<p>"But, Miss Ashton," said little Belle, with
woe-begone voice and look, "I can hardly sew
at all. Aunt Margaret has just begun to teach
me, and she says I <i>do</i> take pains, but I b'lieve
I do it pretty badly yet."</p>

<p>"And I don't know how to sew," said her
cousin, Mabel Walton, who now was sorry that
she had always obstinately refused to learn
how to use a needle.</p>

<p>"I think we can find some easy thing for
you both to do," said Miss Ashton, kindly.
"But remember, dear children, what you
promise, you must perform. If you undertake
this work, you must have it finished at the end
of the time I have named,&mdash;two weeks. I do
not <i>ask</i> you to do it, for the older girls are
willing to do all the work; but I thought it
might be a pleasure to you to help."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! indeed it will, Miss Ashton,"
said Lily, "and I'd like to have two clothes to
make. Mamma says I can sew pretty well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
fur such a little girl, and Nora will show me
how."</p>

<p>"One garment will be enough for you, Lily,"
said Miss Ashton; "if you finish that in time,
it is all we shall need."</p>

<p>"You need not be afraid I won't have it
done in time, Miss Ashton," said Lily. "I
don't put off any more, nor be unpunctual
either. I've been early at school every morning
this week,"&mdash;this was Tuesday,&mdash;"and
mamma said I was beginning to improve. I
couldn't help it very well, I had such a horrid
lesson about an old beggar-woman who was
nothing but a thief; and then Maggie and
Bessie and Belle made me lovely proverb
pictures about the consequences of procrastination,
and Maggie wrote a splendid poem, so
I ought to learn better with all that."</p>

<p>"I think so," said Miss Ashton; "but, by the
way, I wonder if Maggie and Bessie would not
like to join us in this work. They always take
such an interest in all that goes on among us
here that perhaps they would be pleased if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
offered to let them help."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know they would," cried Belle,
always ready to speak in praise of her beloved
little playmates. "I know they would. Maggie
and Bessie are very full of good works; and
they always like to do what we do, if they can,
too."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Miss Ashton. "You
can ask them when you see them, Belle; and
if they would like to help us, tell them to come
in to-morrow, at the close of school. You
can all bring me word then if your parents are
willing for you to undertake this work,
and I will give each one a piece to take
home."</p>

<p>The next morning each little girl brought
word that she had received permission to take
home and make such a garment as Miss Ashton
should see fit to give her; and they had
all been promised help and teaching by their
mammas or other friends.</p>

<p>The curiosity and interest of the class having
been much excited by Lily's glowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
account of the "proverb picture" and poem
furnished her by Maggie, Bessie, and Belle,
she had been persuaded to bring them with
her; and being punctual for the third morning,
she exhibited them before school was opened,
to the great satisfaction and delight of the other
children. They were also displayed to Miss
Ashton.</p>

<p>"Maggie is quite a Murphy, isn't she, Miss
Ashton?" said Lily.</p>

<p>"A what, dear?" asked the young lady,
much puzzled.</p>

<p>"A Murphy&mdash;a M-m-ur-phy," said Lily,
putting severe and long emphasis on the word,
as she saw that her teacher did not yet understand.
"Don't you know what a Murphy is,
Miss Ashton? It means some one very wise
and good, who teaches right things."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Miss Ashton, smiling, as light
broke in upon her; "you mean a Mentor, do
you not, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that's it," said Lily; "but I thought
it was Murphy. But I think Murphy is just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
as pretty a name as Mentor."</p>

<p>"But people would understand your meaning
better if you put the right name, Lily,"
said Miss Ashton, as she rang the bell for
silence.</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie had told Belle that they
would be very glad to join in the work of
making clothes for the poor little orphans; and
accordingly, when school was over and word
was brought that they were below, she was
sent to bring them up to the school-room.
Places were soon found for them among their
former school-mates, who were all delighted to
see them; and, as Bessie said, "it seemed
quite as if they were all young again."</p>

<p>Then Miss Ashton had a large basket of
work brought in, and took from it a number
of little garments cut out, but not made, which
she laid upon the table before her.</p>

<p>"I have six skirts and six aprons here," she
said, "and three calico bags, which our little
orphans must have to hold their lesson-books.
I think we had better give the bags to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
who are the youngest, or the least accustomed
to sewing,&mdash;Bessie, Belle, and Mabel. Then
the rest may choose, so far as you can, whether
you will take a petticoat or an apron; but as
there is more work upon the petticoats than
upon the aprons, I shall think it wiser for
those who are not very industrious and persevering
to take the latter, so that they may
be sure to finish their work. Or perhaps
the older ones, Nellie, Maggie, Grace, and
Dora, might take the skirts, and let the other
five take aprons. As I said yesterday, the
young ladies in the other room will finish
whatever you leave."</p>

<p>All were satisfied with this arrangement but
two.</p>

<p>"Miss Ashton," said Nellie Ransom, in
rather a hesitating voice, as though she thought
she might be drawing upon herself the disapproval
of her classmates,&mdash;"Miss Ashton,
I think perhaps I had better only take an apron.
I do not sew very fast, and I might not have a
skirt done in time; and I would rather take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the apron, so that I may be sure to finish
it."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Lily, "I should think any
one might have a petticoat done in two weeks!
No, not pooh, either, Nellie, I forgot that was
not courteous; but then I should think you'd
have plenty of time to make the skirt, and I'm
going to take one 'stead of the apron, if Miss
Ashton will let me."</p>

<p>"I will let you," said her teacher. "I told
you you should take what you pleased; but,
Lily, I think Nellie is a wise little girl not to
undertake more than she feels <i>sure</i> she can do,
and you would do well to follow her example.
You do not like steady work, you know, Lily,
and I should not wish the petticoat to be
brought back to me half finished."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd never do that!" exclaimed Lily.
"I see, Miss Ashton, you think it <i>probalal</i>
that Nellie and I will be the hare and the
tortoise,&mdash;Nellie the tortoise and I the hare;
but we'll be two tortoises, won't we, Nellie?
And please let me have the petticoat, Miss Ashton.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
I'll be sure, oh, <i>sure</i> to have it finished!"</p>

<p>Miss Ashton did as she was asked, and
handed Lily the skirt; but she looked as if she
were not quite so sure that Lily would perform
all she promised; and though she smiled
as she gave the parcel to the little girl, she
shook her head doubtfully, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Be careful, Lily, and do not put off till to
morrow the task you should do to-day."</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," answered Lily, confidently,
"I am quite cured of that. I wish you'd let
me have two just to see how soon I will have
them finished."</p>

<p>"If you finish the petticoat at the end of
ten days, you shall have some other thing to
make," said Miss Ashton, rather gravely.
"Nellie, my dear, here is your apron."</p>

<p>The work was very neatly cut out and
basted; prepared so that the little girls
might not find it difficult to do, or give more
trouble than was actually necessary to their
friends at home; and each one opened her
parcel and examined it with great satisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
after they were dismissed.</p>

<p>"I expect Nellie's will be sewed the best,
'cause she takes so much pains with every
thing she does," said Bessie. "Hers and
Dora's will be, for Dora is industrious too,
and has a great deal of perseverance."</p>

<p>"I think mine will be the best," said Gracie,
"for I sew very nicely. Mrs. Bradish
told mamma she never saw a child of my age
sew so neatly."</p>

<p>"Proudy!" said Lily, "you always think
you do every thing better than anybody else;
and you always go and tell when any one makes
you a compliment. Gracie, you do grow conceiteder
and conceiteder every day. Pretty
soon, we won't be able to stand you at all."</p>

<p>"Why, Lily!" said Belle, "you're a dreadful
anti-politer this morning."</p>

<p>"I don't care," said Lily; "Gracie does
make me so mad. Yes, I do care about being
called an anti-politer too," she added on second
thoughts; "but, Gracie, I don't believe
your work will be the best. I think like Bessie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
that Nellie's will be, 'cause she sews so
nicely; and so does Maggie."</p>

<p>"Anyhow mine will be done, and yours
won't, I know," retorted Gracie, who always resented
very strongly the idea that any other child
could do as well or better than herself. "You
always put off and procrastinate, so that you
never have any thing ready at the right time."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not going to do so any more,"
said Lily; "and, anyhow, I'd rather be Pro
than Proudy. It's very, very naughty to be
proud, and it's only a&mdash;a&mdash;well, an inconvenient
habit to procrastinate. And I'm pretty
well cured of it now. Don't you be afraid my
petticoat won't be done; and don't let's be
cross about it any more, Gracie."</p>

<p>Peace was restored by her last words; but
here were Lily's snares and stumbling-blocks.
Firstly, that she had too much confidence in
her own strength, and was too sure that she
could cure herself of this troublesome habit if
she only chose to do so; secondly, that she
hardly looked upon it as a fault at all, and did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
not think it of much consequence, except just
at the moment when it had brought some great
annoyance upon herself or others.</p>

<p>Lily was gay, light-hearted, and sweet-tempered,
and trouble or disappointment seldom
oppressed her spirits long,&mdash;all good things
and great blessings in their proper times and
places; but she sometimes let this run into
carelessness, and was often disposed to make too
light of her faults and their consequences. She
certainly had warning and help enough in this
case, if that were all she needed.</p>

<p>She, Maggie and Bessie, Belle and Mabel
all took the same way homeward; and just
before they parted, Maggie said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have an idea! Would it not be a
good plan for us five to have a little sewing
meeting at our house for these clothes, if
mamma has no objections? And it will seem
to help us along, and not let it be so stupid; for
I do hate to sew."</p>

<p>The other children agreed that it would be a
capital arrangement; and Maggie, turning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Bessie, asked if she thought mamma would be
willing.</p>

<p>"For we better not make too many plans
about it till we know what mamma would say,"
said Maggie, "or we might 'live in hope
only to die in despair.'"</p>

<p>Bessie thought mamma would be quite willing,
but agreed with Maggie that it would be
better not to build up too many arrangements
on this till they knew what she had to say.</p>

<p>"I would like to have asked all the class,"
said Maggie, "but I do not think mamma
wants a great many children about now;
because grandmamma's house is being painted,
and she and Aunt Annie and Uncle Ruthven
and Aunt Bessie are all staying with us, and it
makes a pretty large family,&mdash;a lovely large
one," she added, with a nod of satisfaction in
the present size of the household.</p>

<p>"We'll ask mamma if we can have a
meeting once a week till our things are all
finished," said Bessie; "and we can sew on
them between times, and show each other how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
much we have done. And it may be a little
help to you in not putting off, Lily," she said,
rather anxiously. "I would be so sorry if
your petticoat was not finished."</p>

<p>"Oh, never fear," said Lily; "you are all so
afraid about me; and I tell you, I'm not going
to put off any more."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, my daughter, that you took
the petticoat instead of the apron," said Mrs.
Norris, when Lily reached home and told her
story of the morning's business. "There
would have been more hope of your finishing
the apron, with your unsteady ways about
work and duties."</p>

<p>"It is not a duty for me to make this, is it,
mamma?" asked Lily, unrolling the parcel
and holding up the skirt.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is a duty for you to do that which
you have promised to do, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma; but I need not have promised
if I did not choose."</p>

<p>"No, you need not; but now that you have
undertaken it of your own free will, that makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
it all the more a duty for you to finish it in
time. Will you sew on it a little while this
afternoon, after you have had your lunch?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma, I think not," said Lily.
"Maggie and Bessie are going to ask their
mamma if they can have us for a sewing
meeting at their house, and I'll wait and see
what they say. It will be fun."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norris sighed as Lily gleefully rolled
up her work and tossed it upon the table.
This was not a very good beginning.</p>

<p>"Put it away in the large work-box, dear,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Presently, mamma; I'm just going to tell
Nora about it."</p>

<p>"No, Lily, put it away at once. And
remember, my darling, that I shall not allow
Nora to finish it for you if you fall behindhand
through your own fault."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, mamma," said Lily, as she obeyed
her mother's order; "but I would have put it
away in a minute or two."</p>

and by" was long in coming, as it
had often been before; and this although
her mamma and nurse both invited
her more than once to come and begin her
petticoat.</p>

<p>The evening brought a note from Maggie
Bradford, which was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear Lily</span>,&mdash;Mamma says we may have
the sewing meeting, and Aunt Annie says she
will take care of it up in her room, which is
very kind of her; do you not think so? When
Baby Annie heard us talking about it, she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
"Me too;" and we told her she should come
if she would be good. Mamma says she is
afraid she will be a disturbance, but she is so
cunning that Bessie and I could not bear to
tell her no; and we will be very industrious,
even if baby is funny. We make you a life-member
of our society for two weeks, till we
have the clothes all finished; and we will have
a meeting every Thursday afternoon. Come
at three o'clock; and Aunt Annie will tell us
stories or read to us till four, while we sew,
and then we will put away our work and
play.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-left: 14em;">
"Yours respectfully and affectionately,</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Maggie Stanton Bradford</span>.<br />
</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em;">"P. S. Bessie says of course you'd never
think of such a thing as bringing 'Pro' to
the meeting. We wouldn't believe it of you;
but if you did, we should 'speed the parting
guest,' which means to turn him out as quick
as you can."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Maggie knows so many proverbs and wise
speeches, and always knows how to make a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
good use of them," said Lily, when Tom
finished reading this epistle to her, she having
been in too much haste to try to spell it out
for herself. "Now, Tom, what are you laughing
at?"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm sure that is a good joke of
Maggie's, and well worth being amused at,"
said Tom.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Lily, "she is very smart,
and very funny too. I'm so glad we are going
to have the sewing meeting; and, indeed, I
don't take 'Pro' with me."</p>

<p>"I am afraid he has paid us a visit this
afternoon, Lily," said Mrs. Norris.</p>

<p>"Why, no, dear mamma; at least, I only
thought I would wait till I heard what we were
going to do at the meeting, and not begin before
them. It is nicer to begin all together."</p>

<p>"And I think you will find that all the other
children have commenced their work to-day,"
said Mrs. Norris. "But we shall see."</p>

<p>Lily's mamma was nearly as well pleased as
her little daughter at the arrangement she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
made with the Bradford children, for she hoped
that their example, and the wish to keep pace
with them, might help Lily to conquer her
besetting fault in this instance at least; and
that shame might keep her from falling behindhand
with her work from week to week.</p>

<p>The sewing meeting being a novelty, and
Lily very anxious to "see what it would be
like," she was willing to be made ready in good
time the next day; and actually arrived at the
Bradfords' house eight minutes before three
o'clock, which she, as well as the other children,
took to be a decided sign of improvement
in the punctuality line.</p>

<p>Belle was there, but not Mabel, for the latter
had taken a very bad cold, and could not come
out.</p>

<p>The little girls were soon all settled in Aunt
Annie's room, each with her work; but Lily
was rather dismayed, and quite ashamed, to
find her mother's words proved true, and that
each one of the other three children had not
only commenced her work, but had completed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
quite a good piece upon it. Why, there was a
whole seam and part of another done upon
Maggie's petticoat; and she had not yet set
the first stitch in hers!</p>

<p>"Why! haven't you done any on yours
yet?" asked Bessie, in amazement. "Why
didn't you begin it, Lily?"</p>

<p>"I thought to-day would be time enough,"
said Lily, rather sheepishly. "I'm sorry now
I didn't begin it."</p>

<p>"But it's too late to be sorry now," said
Bessie, gravely shaking her head. "Procrastination
has been robbing Time again, Lily."</p>

<p>"Never mind, I'll sew very fast to-day,"
was Lily's answer.</p>

<p>As soon as she had the little girls all busy
at their work, Aunt Annie took up a book, and
prepared to read a story to them.</p>

<p>But scarcely had she commenced when the
door, which stood ajar, was pushed open; and
"Tootins" walked in, with an air which seemed
to say she was quite sure of her welcome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>And who was "Tootins"? you will say. A
kitten?</p>

<p>Well, I believe she was a kind of two-footed
kitten; at least, she was as full of play and
frolic and merry ways as any four-footed little
puss that ever called old cat mother. As fond
of being cuddled and petted now and then, too.</p>

<p>"Tootins" was the dearest, cunningest,
most fascinating little two-year-old bit of
mischief that ever found out she had ten
fingers, and the number of uses they could
be put to.</p>

<p>A mischief! I should think she was! Such
restless, busy little fingers! "Mademoiselle
Touche-à-tout" Uncle Ruthven named her.
Such an inquisitive little mind! Such never-tiring,
pattering little feet! Such a sweet voice,
and such a crooked, cunning tongue!</p>

<p>When you saw her, you wanted to catch her
up, and pet and hug her, she was so fair and
round and dimpled; but that did not always
suit Miss "Tootins." She thought her two
small feet were made to be used, and she did
not choose that they should be deprived of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of their privileges, except by her own free will.
So she generally struggled to be put down
again; and, dear me! how sorry you were to
let her go!</p>

<p>But sometimes, as I have said, she wanted
to be cuddled and petted; and then she would
nestle to you, so dear and sweet, with her
sunny head upon your arm, her great starry
eyes fastened upon your face, while you talked
baby-talk to her, or told her simple verses and
stories. Understand you, do you ask? Indeed,
she understood every thing you said;
more than you could have believed possible.</p>

<p>Pure pink and white skin; eyes blue as
heaven; golden hair; yes, real golden hair, for
when the sunlight fell upon her curls, they
looked like threads of burning gold; shoulders
and hands and arms that looked as if they
were only made to be kissed; a gurgling,
rippling laugh; and oh, such cunning, wheedling
ways! That is our "Tootins;" otherwise,
Baby Annie. <i>Our</i> "Tootins," did I say?
Well, I suppose I must call her Mrs. Bradford's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
"Tootins;" but then, you see, I have drawn
her picture from life, and, having before my
eyes just such a pet and darling of my own, it
came very natural to say "our Tootins."</p>

<p>But how did she come by such a funny
name? you will ask again.</p>

<p>Well, that was a name her little brother
Frankie had given her when she was a tiny
baby; no one knew why he did it, but he did,
and he always called her by it; and of late,
if any one called her by any other name, he
always pretended he did not know of whom
they spoke. And so "Tootins" had come to
be a sort of twin pet name with "Baby," and
little Annie was called as much by one as by
the other.</p>

<p>As I have said, she came in as if quite
assured of her welcome, for Baby Annie was
accustomed to have her society courted, and
rather imagined she was conferring a favor
when she bestowed it upon her friends. Moreover,
she had been promised that she should
join the others on this occasion, why or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
what purpose she did not understand; but she
knew that her sisters had talked of Belle and
Lily coming. She was fond of Belle and Lily,
and had demanded a share in their company,
and here they were now. This she knew very
well, and so she came in, followed by old
nurse, who had her own doubts as to whether
baby would be considered a serviceable member
of the sewing circle.</p>

<p>But "Tootins'" expectations proved well-founded,
for she was greeted with exclamations
of pleasure; and after submitting to the
necessary amount of hugging and kissing, she
was accommodated with a bench at Aunt
Annie's feet, and mammy told that she might
leave her.</p>

<p>But was it really possible that any one
thought baby was going to sit still on that
footstool? If so, she soon undeceived them;
and the busy little fingers were, as usual,
searching about for what mischief they could
find to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>First, she overturned Maggie's workbox,
and having contrived, during the picking up
of the contents, secretly to possess herself of
the eyelet-piercer, was presently discovered
boring holes in her own tiny shoe. The next
thing which took her fancy was a small vase
of flowers, which being within her reach was
dragged over, the water spilled upon the floor
and the flowers scattered, before Aunt Annie
could prevent it. Happily, the vase was not
broken, for which Miss Baby took great credit
to herself, declaring over and over again that
she was "dood,"&mdash;little Pharisee that she was.</p>

<p>By the time that this disturbance was over,
order restored, and the members of the sewing
society settled once more in their places, baby
had retired into privacy behind the window
curtain; and, being suspiciously quiet, Aunt
Annie thought proper to inquire into her
occupation, when she was discovered industriously
taking pins from a pin-cushion, and
sticking them into the carpet.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a mischievous, naughty little
girl!" said Aunt Annie. "Shall I call mammy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
to take you away?"</p>

<p>"No, 'deed, Nan," was the answer; "Nan"
being baby's name for Aunt Annie.</p>

<p>"Will you be good and quiet then?"</p>

<p>"'Es 'deed," said baby, resigning the pin-cushion
into Aunt Annie's hands, and trotting
off in search of fresh pastures.</p>

<p>A large trunk was in the room, the lid
standing open; and Miss Stanton had already
called baby three or four times from its dangerous
neighborhood. But the straps which
kept the lid from falling back seemed to have
a peculiar attraction for the little one; and
once more she went over to the corner where
it was placed, and, taking hold of one of these
straps, would in another moment have crushed
both tiny hands by pulling the whole weight of
the lid upon them, had not Maggie sprung up
and caught it just in time.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>"You had better call nurse to take her
away, Maggie; she is too troublesome, and we
shall accomplish nothing while she is here,"
said her aunt, now really vexed. But when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
she heard this, Baby Annie put up such a
grieved lip and looked so piteous that the
other children all pleaded for her; and Miss
Stanton said she would try her once more.</p>


<p>"Shall Aunt Annie tell you a pretty story?"
she asked, seating the little mischief in the
corner of the sofa, where she would be out of
harm's way so long as she could be persuaded
to remain there.</p>

<p>Baby assented eagerly, for she always liked
a story; and Aunt Annie began, the little one
listening intently, with hands quietly folded in
her lap, and her great blue eyes fixed on her
aunt's face.</p>

<p>"Once there was a little girl, and she was a
very good little girl, and always did as she was
told. When her auntie said, 'You must be
still,' she was as quiet as a little mouse, and
made no noise. When her mamma said,
'Come here,' she always came; and when her
nursey said, 'Do not touch that thing,' she
never touched it. She did not take the pins,
because she knew it was naughty, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
mamma would say, 'No, no;' and she did
not pull at the flowers, because she knew her
auntie would say, 'Let them alone;' and she
did not touch Maggie's workbox, because she
knew she was not to have it. And oh, dear
me! why, she never would do such a naughty
thing as to touch the trunk, because she knew
it would hurt her little fingers, oh, so badly!
and then she would have to cry. So every one
loved this baby, and said, 'What a good little
girl! Come here, good little girl;' and gave
her pretty flowers of her own, and let her stay
in the room, and did not send her away to the
nursery."</p>

<p>Here Aunt Annie paused, to see what effect
her moral tale was making on the small
listener for whose benefit it was intended.
Baby was intensely interested, and when Aunt
Annie ceased speaking, gravely ejaculated the
one syllable, "More."</p>

<p>The other children, who thought this extremely
funny, were trying to hide their smiles
that they might not spoil the lesson the story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
was intended to convey.</p>

<p>"Then there was another little girl," continued
Aunt Annie, "such a naughty little girl,
who would not mind what was said to her.
When her mamma said, 'Don't go to the head
of the stairs when the gate is open,' she would
not mind, but she did go; and she fell down
stairs, and bumped her poor little head. And
she took the piercer, and made holes in her
new shoes; and mamma said, 'Oh, the
naughty baby! She must sit on the bed
with no shoes on because she did such a bad
thing.' And she took the scissors and cut her
little fingers, and they hurt her so badly, and
bled. And the pins too, and she put them in
the carpet where they pricked grandmamma's
feet; and grandmamma said, 'That naughty,
naughty baby!' And what do you think happened
to her one day? She would touch the
trunk when her auntie said, 'Come away;'
and the lid fell down, and cut off all the poor
little fingers, and the little girl had no more
fingers to play with, or to love mamma with,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
or to look at the pretty picture-books with.
Oh, poor little girl! that was because she
would not be good."</p>

<p>Nothing could outdo the intense gravity of
the little one's face and demeanor as she
listened to this thrilling tale, and drank in
each word. It was certainly making a great
impression, Aunt Annie thought.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, thinking to strengthen
and give point to this, "who was the
good little girl who always did as she was
told?"</p>

<p>"Tootins," said the baby, with an air of
supreme self-satisfaction, and conscious virtue,
which set all the other children giggling.</p>

<p>"And who," asked Aunt Annie, trying to
command her own face, as she put the second
question, "was the naughty little girl who
did all those bad things, and was so much
hurt?"</p>

<p>"Na-a-an!" shouted baby, changing her air
of delighted self-approbation to one of stern
reproof and bitter indignation against her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
would-be teacher.</p>

<p>To describe the peals of gleeful laughter
which followed this sudden turning of the
tables would be impossible. Roguish Lily
went capering and whirling about the room
in an ecstasy of fun and enjoyment at this
capital hit; and all thought it the most excellent
joke they had heard this long time. It
would have been impossible to help joining in
their merry peals of laughter, even had not
Aunt Annie herself been heartily amused at
the little rogue's cuteness; and baby, finding
she had said a good thing, joined her own
rippling laugh to the general merriment, to
which she further added by now saying, "Oh,
dear! me so funny."</p>

<p>The laughter and merry voices brought
mamma to see what the great joke could be;
and Miss Baby now thought proper to deprive
them of her society, slipping down from her
nest on the sofa, and running to her mother
with,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Me better do wis my mamma."</p>

<p>"Tootins" always considered she had
"better" do whatever she wished to do.</p>

<p>And now perhaps you will say, What has all
this long story about "Tootins" to do with Lily
and procrastination?</p>

<p>Why, just this; that from the moment the
baby had entered the room, Lily's attention
had been entirely diverted from her sewing.
In vain did that faithful little monitor, Bessie,
endeavor by hints and signs, and softly whispered
words, to persuade her to keep on with
the work already so far behindhand. For to all
her entreaties, Lily only answered, "There's
time enough," or, "I'm going to do it in a
minute," and so forth; while she watched the
baby, and was rather disposed to encourage
her in her mischief. And when Miss Stanton
put little Annie up on the sofa, and began to
tell her the story, Lily dropped her sewing
upon the floor, and, leaving her seat, hung over
the arm of the couch, listening and idling
away her time. The other children were
amused, too, at Annie's pranks, especially at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
this last one, but they kept on sewing industriously;
even little Belle, who was unaccustomed
to it, laboriously and with much
painstaking, setting in stitch after stitch.</p>

<p>But even this good example had no effect
on Lily; and seeing this, Aunt Annie was
not sorry when "the little hindering thing"
declared she had "better do wis" her mother.
Mrs. Bradford thought so too; and carried
away the cunning but provoking monkey.</p>

<p>"O Lily!" said Maggie, reproachfully, "I
thought you were not going to bring Pro with
you."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't," said Lily. "I'm sure I've
been sewing; at least, I've sewed some; and
I was just looking at Annie for a moment."</p>

<p>"For a good many moments, Lily," said
Miss Stanton; "and even when you had your
work in your hand, you put in the stitches
very slowly and carelessly. See there, Lily,"
taking up the end of the seam on which Lily
was now working in great haste, in order to
make up for lost time, "what long, uneven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
stitches, my dear child."</p>

<p>"Oh, they'll do, Miss Annie," said Lily.
"I'll do the rest better; but I must have this
seam done to-day."</p>

<p>Miss Stanton looked grave, and shook her
head, and it was not a usual thing for gay,
merry Annie Stanton to look serious; and
Lily saw that she, like other people, did not
think so lightly of this habit which she considered
of so little consequence.</p>

<p>For, as you will have perceived, Lily had
already forgotten the sad lesson she had received
in the matter of the silver inkstand;
and Maggie, Bessie, and Belle afterwards
acknowledged to one another that their proverb
picture had quite failed to produce the
good effect they had hoped for.</p>

<p>"Let's keep the sewing meeting in a little
longer," she said, when the hour was over,
and the other children were preparing to put
by their work, which had made good progress
during that time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," said Miss Annie, "an hour's steady
work is enough for any little girl, and the
others are tired. They have done enough for
to-day."</p>

<p>"I think I'll do a little more," said Lily,
who felt ashamed as she compared her own
work with that of her young companions, and
saw how much more they had accomplished.</p>

<p>"As you please," said Miss Stanton; "but
I cannot attend to you longer, Lily. I am
going out to dinner, and must dress now. I
hope you will do better before next Thursday."</p>

<p>Lily went away with the others, intending
to sew while they played, at least, for a while;
but, as you may believe, when she saw them all
engaged with their dolls, Procrastination came
and put her virtuous resolution to flight, whispering
that she could make up for lost time
to-morrow; and, as usual, he had his way, and
the petticoat was soon altogether forgotten.</p>

width="51" height="50" alt="L" />
</div><p class="dropcap4"><span class="smcap">"Lily,</span> darling," said Mrs. Norris, on
Saturday morning, "let me see
how the little orphan's petticoat
is coming on."</p>

<p>Lily went, rather sheepishly it must be confessed,
and brought the skirt to her mother.</p>

<p>"Is this all you have done?&mdash;this little
piece of a seam?" said Mrs. Norris. "And
so badly too. Why, my child! what have you
been thinking of? You can sew far better
than this."</p>

<p>Lily fidgeted, and hung her head.</p>

<p>"Did you not all sew yesterday, when you
were at Mrs. Bradford's?" asked her mamma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
examining the work still more closely.</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," murmured Lily.</p>

<p>"And did you not say Miss Annie showed
you how it was to be done?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>"How is it, then, that you have done so very
little, and that little so badly?"</p>

<p>"Why, you see, mamma," said Lily, hesitatingly,
"I did not have much sewed, only a
few stitches, and I wanted to catch up with
the others; and so&mdash;and so&mdash;so the stitches
wouldn't come very nice."</p>

<p>"And why did you not have as much accomplished
as the other children? This is a very
poor hour's work, dear."</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma; but Baby Annie was so funny,
and I couldn't help looking at her, and I
thought I would have time enough. It was
such a horridly short hour; it was gone before
I had time to do much."</p>

<p>"Ah, Lily," said Mrs. Norris, "it is the same
old story, I fear. Procrastination, and want
of attention to the duty of the time, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a little idleness and heedlessness added
to them. These last two are great helpers
to procrastination, Lily; or perhaps I should
say, procrastination is a great helper to the sad
fault of idleness. It is so very easy, when we do
not feel industrious, to believe that another time
will answer as well for the duty or work we
should do now. So the duty is put off; and then,
when shame or need calls us to the neglected
task, it is hurried through heedlessly, and it
may be so badly that it is quite useless, or must
be done over again, as this must, my child."</p>

<p>"Mamma!" exclaimed Lily, in a tone in
which there was displeasure as well as distress.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, my daughter. I cannot allow
this to be returned to Miss Ashton with such
work upon it. You are but a little girl, and no
one would expect to see such neat sewing come
from your hands as from those of an older person;
but I should be ashamed to have it thought
that my Lily cannot do better than this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I'll never have the petticoat done at
all," said Lily, her eyes filling with tears. "It
is 'most a week now since Miss Ashton
gave them to us, and if I have to take that out
it will be all to do from the beginning, and
Maggie and Bessie and Belle have ever so
much done on theirs, and I shan't have one
stitch done on mine."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norris looked grieved at the rebellious
tone.</p>

<p>"Whose fault is it, Lily?" she asked sorrowfully.</p>

<p>Lily hesitated for a moment; then, for the
first time in her life, temper had the better of
her love and reverence for her mother, and she
answered passionately,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Yours</i>, if you make me pull that out!"</p>

<p>For a moment, surprise held Mrs. Norris
silent and motionless. Never before had Lily
spoken so to her; never before had she been
other than her loving, docile little child, not
always strictly obedient it might be, but that
was not so much from wilfulness as from that
sad habit of putting off,&mdash;of not obeying at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
once.</p>

<p>Then the surprise died out, and left only
pain and grief; and while Lily was wondering
what mamma would do, could do, after such a
dreadful thing as that (for the very utterance
of the words had sobered her, and calmed down
her temper), Mrs. Norris rose, and laying down
the skirt, without one word, without one look
at her naughty little child, slowly and sorrowfully
left the room.</p>

<p>Lily stood still one moment, herself almost
breathless with surprise and dismay at what
she had done. Had she really said such
dreadful words to mamma? and could mamma
ever, ever forgive them? Her own dear, loving,
indulgent mamma to hear such words from
the lips of her own, only little daughter.
What would papa say, what would Tom say,
when they should know it? what would Maggie
and Bessie say? For when mamma treated
her as she deserved to be treated from this
time forth, they would surely know that something
was wrong, and must learn what she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
done. And, oh! how angry God must be with
her!</p>

<p>Some little boys and girls, who are in the
habit of saying unkind and disrespectful things
to their mothers,&mdash;and, alas! there are too
many such,&mdash;may wonder at our Lily's distress
and remorse; but Lily was not accustomed
to behave in this way to her mother; as
you have heard, it was the first time in her life
that she had done so, and now she was fairly
frightened when she remembered how she had
let passion master her.</p>

<p>And what had brought this about?</p>

<p>Lily did not think of it just then, in all the
tumult of feeling which swelled her little
heart; but had it not all arisen from the sad
habit of procrastination, of which she thought
so lightly?</p>

<p>She felt as if she dared not run after
her mother, and ask her forgiveness. True,
mamma always was ready to forgive her when
she was penitent after any naughtiness; but
then&mdash;oh! she had never, never done any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
thing like this before&mdash;and Lily threw herself
down upon the rug in a paroxysm of tears
and sobs.</p>

<p>By and by the door was opened, and
Tom came in. He stood still for a moment
in surprise at the state in which he
found his little sister, then came forward.</p>

<p>"My pet, what is it? What is the matter?"
he said, stooping over her, and trying to raise
her. But Lily resisted; and so Tom sat down
on the floor beside her. A fresh burst of sobs
came from Lily.</p>

<p>"What is it, dear?" asked Tom again.
"Shall I call mamma?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no!" sobbed Lily. "She wouldn't
c-c-come if you did. She'll never want to
come near m-me a-a-gain."</p>

<p>"Why? What is wrong?" asked Tom, whose
fears that Lily was ill or had hurt herself
were now removed; for he saw that it was not
bodily but mental trouble which ailed her.</p>

<p>"Oh! I've done the most horrid, the most
dreadful thing, Tom," confessed Lily, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
hardly able to speak for the fast-coming tears
and sobs. "Oh! I spoke so wickedly to mamma;
to my own dear, precious, darling mamma.
It was 'most worse than the inkstand, oh, it was,
it was! I'm so bad, oh, such a bad child!"</p>

<p>"Are you willing to tell me about it?"
asked Tom, soothingly.</p>

<p>Lily raised her head, and threw it upon her
brother's knee, allowing him to wipe away her
tears; although, as she told her story, they
flowed as fast as he dried them.</p>

<p>"Lily," said Tom, hoping that this might
prove a good lesson to her,&mdash;ah! how often
had Lily's friends vainly hoped that the trouble
she brought upon herself might prove of service
to her,&mdash;"Lily, how was it that your
work was so very badly done?"</p>

<p>And Lily made a fresh confession, Tom
gently leading her back to what he truly
suspected to be the first cause of all this
difficulty.</p>

<p>"Lily, dear," he said, "I am sure I do not
want to seem to find fault with you, or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
reproach you when you are feeling so badly;
but I would like you to see how all this has
come about. You think it such a small fault,
such a very little thing, to put off your duties,
and even your pleasures, if it happens to suit
the convenience of the moment. As to pleasures,
I suppose that does not matter much, so
long as we do not let our want of punctuality
interfere with the pleasure of others; but
although it may not be what we call a great
sin in itself, just see into what sin and sorrow
procrastination may lead us. One little duty
neglected or put off may interfere with
another; or, as you have done, we may have
to hurry through with it in such a manner as
to leave it worse than if we had not tried to
do it at all. And so we are disappointed and
vexed, and perhaps we grow cross and ill-tempered,
or fly into a passion, and do some
very wrong or unkind thing."</p>

<p>"Yes; or behave worse than any child that
ever lived, to our darling, lovely, precious
mammas, just like me," broke forth poor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
penitent Lily.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, gravely, but kindly, "you
see to what it has led you,&mdash;disrespect and
impertinence to dear mamma. Is not this enough,
Lil darling, to show you how much pain and
trouble may come from this habit, and why
you ought to try to break yourself of it? It
is not only the inconvenience which <i>must</i> come
from it, but the wrong which <i>may</i> grow from it,
which should teach us to try and keep it from
gaining a hold upon us. Do you see, Lil?"</p>

<p>"I should think I did," said Lily, dolefully,
though she now sat upright, but with a most
rueful and despairing countenance. "I should
think it had made me bad enough to see what
it can do. But, Tom,"&mdash;with an admiring look
at her brother from the midst of her gloom
and distress,&mdash;"but, Tom, what a wise boy you
are! You talk as if you were grown up; quite
as if you were a minister; only I understand
all you say, and I don't understand all ministers
say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," said Tom, speaking
more gayly; "but we will not have any more
preaching just now, only&mdash;I would like to
tell you a story, Lily. Shall I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, please do," answered Lily,
brightening a little at the prospect.</p>

<p>"It is a very sad story, but I thought it
would just fit here," said her brother.</p>

<p>"I'm not in a state of mind for a pleasant
story," said Lily, who had lately fallen into
the way of using long words, and "grown-up"
phrases, after the example of her little friends,
Maggie and Bessie.</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not," said Tom, suppressing
all inclination to smile. "Well, you know
Will Sturges, Lily?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, that very sorry-looking boy, whose
father is dead, you told me," said Lily. "Tom,
it always makes <i>me</i> feel sorry to see him. He
hardly ever smiles, or looks happy. You
know mamma told you to ask him here often,
and see if you could not brighten him up;
but he don't seem to brighten up at all.
Bessie said he looked 'as if he had a weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
on his mind' all the time."</p>

<p>"Ah! that is just it," said Tom. "He has
a terrible weight on his mind; a grief that is
there night and day. He thinks it is through his
fault that his father was killed; and I suppose
that it is so. At least it was brought about
by a small neglect of his,&mdash;procrastination, or
putting off, Lily."</p>

<p>"Did he ever put off?" asked the little girl,
opening great eyes of wonder. "Why, he
always seems so very punctual, so very ready
just when he ought to be."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom, "but he was not always
so, dear. Never was a more unpunctual, a
more dilatory boy than Will Sturges used to
be. Poor dear fellow! he has learned better
by such a sad lesson. I hope my little sister
may never have the like."</p>

<p>"I'm sure," said Lily, "I don't know who
has had a sad lesson, if I have not."</p>

<p>"Ah! but, Lily," said her brother, "you have
yet the time and chance to show you are sorry,
and want to try to do better&mdash;if you really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
do repent&mdash;and to gain forgiveness from the
one you have injured,&mdash;dear mamma; but
poor Will, he never had the chance to make up
for his neglect of his duty."</p>

<p>"Tell me," begged Lily, all curiosity and
interest.</p>

<p>"Well," said Tom, "Will Sturges used to
be, as he is now, about the brightest and
quickest boy in our class."</p>

<p>Lily shook her head doubtfully at this; it
was all Tom's modesty, she thought, and more
than she could conveniently believe. Tom
understood her, but continued his story without
interruption.</p>

<p>"But, for all that, he never was at the head
of his class, nor even took a very high standing
in it; for never was such a boy for being
behindhand as Will Sturges. Every thing
that could be put off was put off, and he never
seemed to like to attend to any duty or task
at the proper moment. It was not laziness
either, for he would leave some small task
which should have been done at once, perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to take up one that was far harder, but which
might well have waited till he had finished the
first. He never could be persuaded to attend
to his regular lessons <i>first</i>, but would let himself
be led away from them, not always by
play or pleasure, but often to take up some
book which there was no need for him to
study, always believing and saying that there
was 'time enough'&mdash;'no hurry'&mdash;'by and
by he would do it,' and so forth; until, as you
may suppose, his lessons were left until the
last moment, when they would be scrambled
through, and Will just contrived to keep himself
from disgrace. It was so with every
thing; he never was ready in time for either
work or pleasure. If he were going on a
journey, or any excursion, ten to one but he
was left behind by being too late for the boat
or train; all his own fault too, for his father
and mother used to take pains enough to have
him ready in time. When Mr. Peters took
the school on a picnic or frolic, it was always
a part of the entertainment to see Will come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
tearing down the dock, or by the side of the
cars just at the last moment, often <i>after</i> the
last moment, and when it was too late. No
boy in school had so many tardy marks; none
lost so many books, papers, and pencils, because
he always thought it was time enough to put
them in their places by and by. No lesson did
him any good, no disappointment or inconvenience
he brought upon himself seemed to
cure him; until at last the sad thing happened
of which I am going to tell you.</p>

<p>"One afternoon his father said to him,
'Will, if you are going out, I wish these
papers posted at the station. Take them with
you, and attend to them at once, my son, before
you go upon your own errand. They must
go to grandfather by to-night's train. Can I
depend upon you for once?' 'Yes, indeed,
you may, sir,' promised Will, meaning what
he said too; and when he left the house, he
intended to go directly to the post-office station.
But he had not gone far when he met a friend;
and this boy begged him to go home with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and see a fine new dog he had just bought.
Will hesitated, looked at his watch, and found
that there were still nearly two hours before
the next mail would leave the station, that
mail by which the papers must go if they were
to reach the evening train. 'There'll be plenty
of time, and all papa cared for was that
they should reach the station before the mail
left it,' he said to himself; and he went with
his friend. He stayed with him more than
an hour; then he said good-by, having, as he
promised himself, more than time enough to
reach the post, and mail his papers. But, just
as he was about leaving the house, a little
brother of his friend fell downstairs, hurting
himself very badly; and, in the hurry and distress
of the moment, he was begged to run for
the doctor. He forgot his papers&mdash;indeed,
how could one refuse such an errand at such a
time?&mdash;and ran for the doctor, who lived far
off, and in quite a different direction from the
station. This last was not his fault, and if he
had obeyed his father at once all would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
been right; but, what with one thing and another,
he was too late, and the mail had left.
He tried all he could to send the papers by
that evening train, but it was useless, for he
could find no one to take charge of them, and
he knew it would not do to trust them to
chance hands. So he could do nothing but
take them home again, which he did, and confessed
his fault. His father looked very grave;
but, as poor Will has often told me, did not
scold him, only saying, 'Then I shall probably
have to leave town myself to-morrow, and it
will be a great inconvenience to me. I fear,
my boy, that you will never learn the value
of punctuality and the evil of procrastination
until they are taught you by some severe
lesson.' Poor, dear old Will! what a lesson
that was to be! Well, his father was telegraphed
the next day to come himself, since
the papers had not arrived; and he left his
home, Lily, never to come back. The train
by which he went met with a fearful accident,
and Mr. Sturges was killed in an instant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
And from that day Will has been the sad,
melancholy fellow you see him; for he blames
himself for his father's death, and says but for
him he would have remained at home, and so
been safe. And, Lily, we must see that it is so,
and that, if Will had not put off the duty he
should have attended to, all this would probably
never have taken place. If you could
hear him talk about it!"</p>

<p>Lily drew a long sigh, partly from pity for
Will Sturges, partly from dread of what sorrows
might come to herself if she were not
cured of this sad fault, then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, after all, Tom, he was not so bad to
his father as I was to mamma, for he did not
mean to be naughty, and I'm afraid I did. Do
you know, I was in a real passion, a <i>passionate</i>
passion, with mamma. O, Tom! what shall
I do?"</p>

<p>"What ought you to do first?" asked
Tom.</p>

<p>"Go and ask mamma to forgive me; but
how can she, Tom?" asked Lily, sobbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
again.</p>

<p>"Mamma would forgive any thing, if she
thought you were truly sorry," said her
brother.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I am," answered the little girl.
"If she could see in my heart, she would
know it very well."</p>

<p>"You can show her what is in your heart,
dear, by letting her see that you are really trying
to break yourself of the troublesome fault
which has led you to behave so to her."</p>

<p>Lily threw her arms around her brother's
neck, and kissed him; the next moment she
was gone in search of her mamma. When
she reached her, she could find no words,
none but a piteous "O mamma!" But her
voice and her face spoke for her; and in
another moment she was clinging fast around
her mother's neck, her dear, kind arms
about her, her kiss of forgiveness on the little
head which buried itself in shame and contrition
upon her shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>But, though Lily was forgiven, she could not
recover her spirits all that day, a thing very
unusual with her; but then, as she said, she
had "never been so wickedly naughty before,"
and she felt as if she could not do enough to
make up to her mother for her offence.</p>

<p>She was rather droll, too, as she was apt to
be, when by any means she fell into low
spirits.</p>

<p>When her papa came home, she did not go
to meet him with her usual light and dancing
step; and he missed that, and the joyous face
with which she was accustomed to greet him.</p>

<p>"Why," he said, "what ails my little sunbeam
to-day?" for Mr. Norris had heard
of Belle's idea about the sunbeams in the
family, and he delighted to call his Lily so.</p>

<p>"I'm not a sunbeam to-day, papa," said
Lily.</p>

<p>"You're not a little cloud, I hope," said
papa.</p>

<p>"Oh, no!" answered Lily, mournfully, "not
even so good as a cloud. I've been so very,
very naughty that I believe I'm a&mdash;a"&mdash;Lily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was racking her imagination for a comparison
that should seem severe enough enough&mdash;"I've
been quite a January thaw, papa."</p>

<p>Mr. Norris opened the door of the coat
closet, and hastily put his head therein, taking
a remarkably long time to hang up his hat,
Lily thought.</p>

<p>Now you must know that a January thaw
was Lily's idea of all that was most disagreeable
in the weather. For, the last winter, she
had had a severe attack of diphtheria; and
just as she was well enough to go out, a long
spell of damp, foggy days set in, keeping her
a prisoner for some weeks longer, and depriving
her of many little pleasures on which she
had set her heart.</p>

<p>"She must not go outside of the door until
this January thaw is over," the doctor said
several times; and Lily had come to look upon
this as the very worst specimen of weather.</p>

<p>"Don't you scorn me, papa?" she asked,
when she had made her confession to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I do not scorn you by any means,
Lily," he answered; "and I am glad to see
that you do really feel your fault, for it gives
me hope that you may try to correct it with
more earnestness than you have yet done."</p>

<p>And then he talked to her for some time
longer, setting before her very plainly all the
trouble and inconvenience, yes, and sin too,
which might come from indulgence in this
habit of procrastination.</p>

<p>Certainly our Lily did not want for teachers,
both wise and kind; for her friends, young
and old, seemed all to have set themselves to
give her help in the right way, if she would
but heed them.</p>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-i.jpg"
width="50" height="50" alt="I" />
</div><p class="dropcap3"><span class="smcap">It</span> did really seem now that Lily was
taking herself to task in earnest, and
it was surprising to see how much
she improved during the next few days.
There was no more dilly-dallying with any
little duty or task she had to perform; if
her mother or any other person asked some
small service from her, she ran promptly and
at once; when Nora called her to make ready
for school or her walk, there was no more
stopping "only to do this," or "just to look at
that." She was not once tardy at school;
not once late at meals, a thing which her father
disliked extremely, but to which Lily had until
now paid but little heed. Play and nonsense
were given up at school, save at the proper
times, and she came to her classes with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
lessons correctly prepared; for, when Lily
failed here, it was not from stupidity, or want
of quickness, but simply from idleness, or her
habit of saying "there's time enough still."</p>

<p>The little petticoat, too, was progressing
nicely, with a prospect of being finished in time
after all; for Lily had begged her mamma to
divide it off into certain portions, so much to
be done on each day, that she might know her
appointed task, and so be sure to have it completed.
And she persevered, though the little
unaccustomed fingers did grow rather tired
every day before they were through with the
allotted portion of seam or hem; for, having
been so idle, or rather procrastinating, she
found it hard to make up for lost time.
Now she regretted that she had not taken the
advice of her mother and teacher, and chosen
one of the little aprons, instead of the petticoat.</p>

<p>Nora could not bear to see her plodding
away over it, and more than once begged Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Norris to let her help Lily, or "give her a lift,"
as she called it.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Norris refused, for she had told
Lily that she would not allow this; and much
as she would have liked to relieve her little
girl, she did not think it best, and hoped that
the burden she had brought upon herself might
be of service to her.</p>

<p>However, when the next Thursday came,
and Lily was to go to the second "sewing meeting,"
she was very glad that she had so much
done on her petticoat.</p>

<p>"For I would be too ashamed to go to-day
if I had not done better than I did last
week, mamma," she said. "And two or three
of the children in our class have finished their
work already; and here is old me with mine
not quite half done."</p>

<p>Lily was very "scornful," as she would have
called it, of herself in these days, and rather
delighted in heaping uncomplimentary names
and reproaches upon her own head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>When she reached Mrs. Bradford's house at
the appointed time, she was rather dismayed
to find that, in spite of her industry of the last
few days, the other children had accomplished
much more than she had done. Maggie's skirt
was so near completion that she had but a little
piece of the hem to do; and she had only left
this, in order that she might, as she said keep
company with the rest in the sewing meeting.
And Maggie had made a button-hole! Yes,
actually made a button-hole! It was her
first attempt, but still it was tolerably well
done. It had cost her a good deal of trouble
too, and even some few tears; but she had
persevered, and now was glad that she had
done so.</p>

<p>"Patience and Perseverance conquer all
things, you know," she said to Lily, when
Bessie, with some pardonable pride in her
sister's success, displayed this triumph of art;
"but I really thought that button-hole must
conquer me, only I wouldn't let it, if I did
cry a little about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Bessie, too, had nearly finished her bag; and
though Belle was rather behind the others, she
had a fair prospect of being quite through with
her task in time.</p>

<p>They all encouraged Lily, and told her she
might still finish her petticoat by the appointed
day, if she would but continue to do as well as
she was now doing.</p>

<p>The sewing meeting passed off this day
without hindrance; for Baby Annie was not
admitted; and there was nothing else especially
to take off Lily's attention from the task
in hand. Aunt Annie read an interesting
story, it was true, but all the little girls sewed
industriously as they listened; and at the end
of the hour Maggie's petticoat and Bessie's bag
were completed, while those of Belle and Lily
had made fair progress.</p>

<p>"I have only three more days," said the
latter, "for you know we have to give in the
things on Tuesday, and this is Thursday."</p>

<p>Lily's tone was rather hopeless.</p>

<p>"I think you might finish your skirt in two
days, Lily," said Miss Stanton. "Two hours'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
steady work such as you have given to it to-day
would be quite time enough. If I were you I
should sew one hour to-morrow, and one on
Saturday, so that you may have little or nothing
for your last day, Monday."</p>

<p>"Why wouldn't it do just as well to keep
some for Monday?" asked Lily, folding up her
work.</p>

<p>"Only that if you could finish it in the next
two days it would be better," answered Miss
Annie, "because something might happen to
prevent you from doing so at the last moment."</p>

<p>"Don't have any more putting-off fits,
Lily," said Maggie. "Don't you find 'distance
lends enchantment to the view' of Pro? What
are you laughing at, Aunt Annie? There is
such a proverb, for I read it this very morning,
only I didn't think I should have a good chance
to use it so soon. I'll show it to you, so you
need not think I made it up."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Annie, catching the
rosy, eager face between her two hands, and
lovingly kissing either dimpled cheek. "It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
an old, old proverb, and one very well known,
dear Maggie; and let us hope that Procrastination
may indeed look so much better at a
distance than near at hand that Lily may
keep it there, and not let it come near her."</p>

<p>"Aunt Annie," said Bessie, "you must
be a very laughable person, for so often
you laugh at things that we don't think
funny at all."</p>

<p>"That is true," answered Aunt Annie,
whose eyes were brimming with mischief,
while she laughed more merrily than ever.</p>

<p>"Well," said Lily, "I did not quite understand
what Maggie meant till Miss Annie
said that, but I do know now; and, indeed, I
do think Pro is better far off than close by.
I'm sure I am a great deal better anyway,
and I shall never let him come near me
again."</p>

<p>Bessie stood looking gravely at her as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"I see you don't quite trust me, Bessie,"
said Lily, "but you'll see. If you only knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
all that I know, you'd learn what good reason
I have for believing I shall never procrastinate
again; but I'd rather not tell you what it is."</p>

<p>For Lily did really shrink from letting her
little playmates know of her sad behavior to
her dear mother, although she could not refrain
from alluding to it in this mysterious manner.</p>

<p>"You know you're all coming to my house
to spend the day with me on Saturday," she
continued; "and before you come, I shall have
the petticoat all finished, and will show it to
you."</p>

<p>Lily kept faithfully to her resolution upon
the next day, sewing industriously for a full
hour, and then putting by her work with the
consciousness that she had accomplished all
that could be expected of her for that day.
Perhaps she had been further encouraged to
do so by hearing most of her young schoolmates
say that morning that their little garments
were quite finished, and ready to be
handed in to Miss Ashton on Tuesday. Even
Mabel Walton, although she had been quite ill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
with a bad cold, had completed her bag; and
little Belle hoped and expected to put the last
stitches in her's on that afternoon.</p>

<p>"Is your apron done, Nellie?" asked Lily
of Nellie Ransom.</p>

<p>"Not quite," answered Nellie, "and I shall
not finish it before to-morrow, for my two little
cousins are in town to-day, and I must give up
this afternoon to them. I am glad that I took
the apron instead of the petticoat, for I am sure
I should not have had time to make the last."</p>

<p>"You could have tried," said Gracie. "I'm
sure a petticoat is not so much to make. Mine
was all done on Saturday evening, and I did
not have any help or showing either. Mamma
is away, and I wouldn't let my nurse help me,
but did it every bit myself. But then every
one says I'm uncommonly handy with my needle;"
and Gracie gave her head the toss which
always excited the displeasure of her schoolmates.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nellie, coloring and hesitating
a little, "I felt pretty sure that I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
make the petticoat in time, and I thought it
was better to take that which I knew I could
do; and now you see I should feel badly if I
could not bring in my work when the rest do."</p>

<p>"Yes, and you were very right," said Belle.
"I told Aunt Margaret about you, and she said
you were a wise, prudent little girl."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be such a slow poke as Nellie,
would you?" whispered Gracie to Lily, when
Nellie had moved away a little.</p>

<p>"I s'pose I'd be as I was made, and I s'pose
you'd be as you were made," said Lily, loftily,
for her "scorn," as she would have called it,
was always excited by Gracie's attempts to
exalt herself above her companions and schoolmates,
and it rather delighted her to put Gracie
down.</p>

<p>This was difficult, however. Gracie's self-sufficiency
was so great that only a very hard
blow could overthrow it, even for a moment;
and Lily was too much afraid of being
considered an anti-politer to speak her
mind as plainly as she might otherwise have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
done.</p>

<p>So Gracie was not at all rebuffed by the
answer she received; and, so far from taking
it as the reproof Lily intended it to be, only
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; but I'm very glad I was
made smarter than Nellie. Why, sometimes
I can learn three lessons while she is learning
one, she is so slow and stupid!"</p>

<p>"She is <i>not</i> stupid," retorted Lily, forgetting
her determination to "be courteous" in her
indignation; and, indeed, Gracie often made it
difficult for those about her to keep to this resolution.
"She is <i>not</i> stupid, and if she is a little
bit slow about learning, she always knows
her lessons perfectly, and never misses; no,
never. You know she's been head of the
spelling class for most a year; you know it,
Gracie, and Miss Ashton says she is one of
her very best scholars. And the whole world
knows"&mdash;Lily was waxing energetic in her
defence, and more earnest to be emphatic than
strictly according to facts&mdash;"the whole world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
knows that she writes the best compositions
in our class since Maggie Bradford left."</p>

<p>"Pooh! I never thought Maggie's compositions
were so very great," said Gracie.</p>

<p>"That shows you're no judge, and have very
little common sense," said Lily severely. "I'm
sure no one could write better poetry than that
poem she wrote for me, and you might be proud
if you could make such lovely verses. But I
don't want to quarrel with you, Gracie, so we'd
better not talk any more about it, 'cause I do
feel like saying something not courteous to you."</p>

<p>Gracie in her turn would have liked to say
something that was not very pleasant, but she
felt that she could not well do so when Lily
declared her intention of not quarrelling, and
retired in such a graceful manner from the
threatened dispute. Still she did feel that
somehow Lily had had the best of it, and
had rather taken her down, as she was apt to
do when Gracie displayed her vanity and self-conceit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, clever and bright though she
might be at her lessons, Gracie was not very
quick at words; and she often felt that Lily
had the advantage of her in their too frequent
little disputes. And now while she was hesitating
as to whether she should make a sharp
answer, and what that answer should be, Miss
Ashton came in and rang the bell; so that the
opportunity, or I should say temptation, for
further contention was at an end.</p>

<p>"I hope," said Miss Ashton, when the time
came for dismissing school, "I hope that not one
of my little girls will fail me on Tuesday.
I should be very much disappointed, and mortified
too, if I did not receive each garment quite
finished and ready for use. Some of you I
know are already through with the work which
you have undertaken; and after what I have
said, I believe and hope there is no one who
will be willing to bring hers unfinished."</p>

<p>Her eye rested on Lily as she spoke.
Perhaps she was hardly conscious that it was
so, but she almost involuntarily turned to her
as the one who was most likely to fail; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
however that might be, the little girl felt herself
called upon to answer, not only for
herself, but for the whole class.</p>

<p>"We'll be very sure to be ready, Miss
Ashton," she said; "and I will too. I see you
are afraid of me, but you need not be, for I
b'lieve I'm quite cured now of putting off."</p>

<p>Miss Ashton smiled, but it was rather a
doubtful smile, for she feared that Lily was
too confident of herself, and the strength of
her own resolutions.</p>

<p>So, as I have said, all this made Lily feel
very industrious and prompt that day; and as
soon as she was at liberty for the work, she
set to her task at once, and accomplished it
without delay.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this, the day did not
pass by without a fall into the old bad habit,
as you shall learn.</p>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-s.jpg"
width="51" height="50" alt="S" />
</div><p class="dropcap2"><span class="smcap">Saturday</span> came, a bright and beautiful
day, as Lily rejoiced to see when
she ran to the window and peeped
out as soon as she was out of her little bed.</p>

<p>For she was to have quite a party of
children to spend the day with her, and she
had been very anxious that the weather should
be pleasant.</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie, Belle and Mabel, and
Nellie and Carrie Ransom were all coming,
and they expected to have a great frolic. All
Lily's playmates were fond of visiting her, not
only because they loved her, and her home
was a pleasant one, but also because there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
such a grand play-room in Mr. Norris' house.</p>

<p>This was a great open attic hall or gallery.
The house was a large one, and this open
space ran across the whole width of it, the
attic rooms being at either end, and a staircase
coming up at the side. But this was shut
in by a door at the foot of the flight, so that it
was quite secluded, and considered rather an
advantage, as it afforded a kind of retiring
room. There were large bins ranged on the
opposite side from the stairs, which had once
been used to hold coal and wood; but they were
empty now, and the top of the lids afforded
capital seats for the spectators who witnessed
certain performances which frequently took
place in the open arena. Never was there
such a famous garret, or one which had seen
greater sport and fun.</p>

<p>Here the children could make as much
noise as they pleased without fear of disturbing
older people; here there was plenty of
space for playing "tag," "hunt the slipper,"
"chairs," or any other frolicsome game; here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
they acted proverbs, charades, and so forth.
These last were now their favorite amusements,
and Mr. Norris' attic was considered the best
place for their performance.</p>

<p>For, added to these other advantages, there
was also a room devoted to the storing of all
manner of odds and ends which were not in
general use, and were stored there to be out of
the way; and with certain of these articles
the children were allowed to do as they pleased,
and to make them serviceable in their games
and plays. Among them were two or three
old trunks full of old party dresses and
ribbons; and any little girl can imagine what
delightful means these afforded for "dressing
up." There were flags, too, of various sizes
and conditions, old-fashioned curtain fixtures,
and even a tent of striped red and white
canvas. All these Lily and her playmates
were allowed to convert to their own uses, so
long as they destroyed nothing; and many an
hour did patient Nora, ever devoted to the
pleasure of her nursling, spend in putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
them to rights after they had been thoroughly
rummaged and scattered abroad.</p>

<p>Chief among the treasures in the attic was
an old rocking-horse which had belonged to
Tom; at least he had once been a rocking-horse,
but he had now not only lost his
rockers, but also his hind legs. Strange to
say, however, this did not at all interfere with
his usefulness; perhaps it rather added to it,
for when he was supposed to fill his original
character, namely, that of a horse, he was
accommodated with two imaginary limbs in
the place of the missing members, and he
never complained that they did not answer
the purpose quite as well.</p>

<p>The number of uses to which he was put,
and the characters he was supposed to represent,
would be impossible to tell. Sometimes
he was a prince, and sometimes a beggar or a
robber; sometimes a servant, and sometimes
a lover or husband; sometimes a little boy, at
others a cross old man; again he was converted
into an elephant by having the end of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
curved iron pipe thrust into his mouth, or into
a camel by a pillow upon his back; at times,
a fierce wild beast, growling and raging; at
others, the meekest of sheep or cows, mild
and gentle in all respects. At one time he
spoke in a squeaking but plaintive voice; at
another in what was supposed to be a deep,
roaring bass.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that he had lost his tail as
well as his legs; and his beauty was farther
increased by the fact that Maggie and Lily, finding
his ears inconvenient for the proper fitting
of crowns, caps, wreaths, and other decorations,
had cropped them close to his head. He had
also been shorn of his hair in various places,
which gave him a mangy and distressed
appearance; so that, save in the eyes of his
most intimate and attached friends, he was
not a horse of very fine personal appearance.</p>

<p>This gallant and accommodating steed
rejoiced in the name of Sir Percy Hotspur;
but this was laid aside when convenience
demanded it, and he obligingly answered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the name of the moment.</p>

<p>Dear to the hearts of Lily and her young
friends was Sir Percy Hotspur; and he was
always tenderly cared for after he was through
with his performances, being left to repose in
the intervals in a corner of the attic, with his
head upon an old sofa pillow, and carefully
covered with a disused carriage robe.</p>

<p>What a long history of an old rocking-horse,
you may say, and so it is; but, you see, Sir
Percy Hotspur played a very important part
in Lily's life, and she was deeply attached to
him, and as this is her story, whatever concerned
her deserves our attention.</p>

<p>With so many attractions, you may believe
that an invitation to Lily's house was always
considered desirable, and eagerly accepted.</p>

<p>Never, I think, were four little girls who
found more enjoyment in their small lives
and in one another, than our Maggie and Bessie,
Belle and Lily. They were so much
together that whatever interested one interested
all the others, and any pleasure was increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
if they could all share it together.</p>

<p>But we must go to the history of this Saturday.</p>

<p>"Lily," said Mrs. Norris, as the family left
the breakfast table, "it is nine o'clock now;
and if I were you, I would finish that little
petticoat at once. I think you can do it in an
hour, and then it will be off your mind and
conscience; and after you have practised for
half an hour, you can enjoy yourself for the
rest of the day as you please."</p>

<p>"I don't believe the children will come before
twelve o'clock, do you, mamma?" asked
Lily.</p>

<p>"No, probably not."</p>

<p>"Then I have three hours," said Lily.
"That is lots of time, and I shall be sure to
have it done, even if I don't begin right away."</p>

<p>"Take care, Lily," said her mother, lifting
a warning finger, and shaking her head with a
smile which told the little girl what that warning
meant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, mamma," she answered
"I'll be sure to do it this morning; and even if
I did not quite finish it, I have Monday too."</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Norris shook her head, and this
time without the smile; for she plainly saw
that Lily was in one of her careless, putting
off moods, and she feared the work would
suffer.</p>

<p>"I am going right away, mamma," said
Lily, as she saw how grave her mother
looked; and away she danced, singing as she
went.</p>

<p>But as she ran through the hall, she met
her brother Tom with his puppy, which he was
going to take for a walk. Lily never saw the
little dog without stopping to have a romp
with him, and the playful little fellow was
growing fond of her already, and was always
eager for the frolic with which she indulged
him.</p>

<p>He sprang upon her now, whining and crying
with pleasure at seeing her, and Lily stopped,
of course, to pet him, and then began racing
up and down through the hall; while Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
good-naturedly waited, and stood by, laughing
at the antics of the two frolicsome young
things. Gay and careless as the puppy himself,
Lily had no more thought for the task
awaiting her.</p>

<p>I do not know that she should be very much
blamed for this; but few little girls who would
not have done the same, and Lily knew that
there was much more than time enough for the
completion of the petticoat. But I want to show
you how the moments, yes, and the hours too,
slipped away; how little bits of idling and procrastination
stole away the time before she was
aware, and in the end brought her into sad
trouble.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour went by in Lily's frolic
with the puppy, until at last Tom said he must
go.</p>

<p>"I would take you with me, Lil," he said,
"only that I know mamma wishes you to do
your work."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily reluctantly; and but for
very shame she would have begged to put off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
her work and accompany him.</p>

<p>Tom and his dog were gone, and Lily sauntered
towards the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"I don't feel a bit like sewing now," she
said to herself. "I could have gone with
Tom, and been back time enough to finish my
petticoat. Every one is so particular about my
putting-off, and they never want me to do any
thing <i>I</i> want to. But I s'pose I'll have to finish
the old thing now."</p>

<p>Lily, you see, was allowing temptation to
creep in. She did not still its first whisperings,
but suffered them to make her feel discontented
and fretful.</p>

<p>She had stopped at the foot of the staircase,
and with both hands clasped about the newel-post,
was swaying herself back and forth, when
Nora spoke to her from the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>"Miss Lily," she said, by way of a gentle
reminder, "do you need any help with your
work?"</p>

<p>"No, I b'lieve not," answered the little girl.
"If I do, I'll come to you. I was just thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
where I'd go to sew."</p>

<p>"Will you come to the nursery? It is all
put in order," asked Nora, anxious to carry
her point, and seeing from Lily's manner that
her old enemy was busy with her.</p>

<p>"I'll see presently," said Lily. "I'm just
going to the little parlor to look for my petticoat.
I forget what I did with it yesterday
when I had done sewing."</p>

<p>And, leaving her hold of the banisters, she
crossed the hall. But as she passed the open
door of the drawing-room, the piano caught
her eye, and turned her thoughts into another
channel.</p>

<p>"I think I'll go and practise first," she said.
"It's all the same thing, and I can do the petticoat
afterwards. I have just the same time."</p>

<p>This was true enough, but Lily was not
wise, for she liked to practise, and she did not
like to sew; and it would have been better for
her to have done with the least pleasant duty
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>She placed herself at the piano, and, I must
do her the justice to say, practised steadily for
half an hour.</p>

<p>"It is ten minutes of ten," she said, looking
at the clock. "Oh, there's lots of time yet; I
can stay here a little longer. I'm going to
practise this new piece some more."</p>

<p>This new piece was one Miss Ashton had
given her the day before, so that she had had
but one lesson on it; and it had all the charm
of novelty to her, besides being, as she thought,
the prettiest piece she had ever played.</p>

<p>"I'll astonish Miss Ashton by letting her
see how well I have learned it," she said to
herself; and she remained at the piano, playing
over and over again the lively little waltz,
until her mother's voice at the door recalled
her to her neglected duty.</p>

<p>"Lily," it said, "you have been practising
more than half an hour, dear."</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," said Lily, glancing over at
the clock again; "more than three quarters;
but my new music is so very pretty, and I want
Miss Ashton to be quite surprised with my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
knowing it so well."</p>

<p>"I am afraid Miss Ashton may have a less
agreeable surprise if you do not take care, my
darling," said Mrs. Norris gravely.</p>

<p>"Oh, you mean about the petticoat, mamma;
but there's lots and lots of time. I b'lieve Pro
has had hold of me this morning," said Lily,
jumping down from the piano stool, "and I'll
come right away; but you see I was so very
sure about having time enough to-day, mamma,
that it did not make so much difference.
There's a good deal of time yet to-day, and I
have Monday too."</p>

<p>"Put away your music, Lily," said her
mother; and she stood waiting while Lily laid
in its place the music she would have left scattered
over the piano. Perhaps Mrs. Norris
thought it just as well not to lose sight again
of her heedless little daughter until she had
her settled at her work.</p>

<p>"Bring your work-box to my room," said
Mrs. Norris. "I have something to do there,
and we will have a nice, cosey time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Lily ran for the box, and was back with it
in a moment, for as she went she said to herself,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I b'lieve I've let Pro steal a good many
little thefts already this morning; now I'll
just send him off right away. I have plenty
of time yet, but now I really must make
haste."</p>

<p>Lily's work-box was of rather formidable
dimensions; indeed, some people thought it
but one stage removed from a small trunk.
It had been presented to her by an old lady
with whom she was a great pet, and although
it was extremely inconvenient in regard to size
and weight, it was very handsomely fitted up
with mother-of-pearl and silver, and contained
every implement which could be needed by the
most accomplished needle-woman. Upon the
lid was a silver plate, with "For an industrious
little girl" engraved upon it.</p>

<p>Now as we know, our Lily was by no means
an industrious little girl; nevertheless she
took great pride and delight in this "ark," as
Tom privately called it; and, although she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
two or three other work-boxes and baskets
much more suitable and convenient in point
of size, she made use of this one whenever she
could do so.</p>

<p>"It held so much," she said, and indeed it
did; and here the petticoat had reposed in the
intervals when she was not busy with it; that
is, when Lily had put it away in a proper
manner.</p>

<p>She followed her mother with this ponderous
treasure clasped in both arms; and, when she
reached mamma's room, brought her little
chair, and opened the box.</p>

<p>"Why," she said, when she had removed
the upper tray which held all the dainty implements,
and looked into the empty space beneath,
"why, where is my petticoat? Somebody has
gone and taken it out. Mamma, did you take
it?"</p>

<p>"No, dear, I have not touched it," said Mrs.
Norris. "Did you put it away yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, you know I always put it in
here. I'll ask Nora;" and away ran Lily to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the nursery.</p>

<p>"Nora, did you take my orphan petticoat
out of my work-box?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, dear; and why would I touch
it, unless you wanted some help with it?"
answered Nora.</p>

<p>Back went Lily to her mamma's room,
troubled and indignant.</p>

<p>"Mamma, some one has taken it. I never
knew any thing so mean. Nora don't know
any thing about it."</p>

<p>"Who would take it, Lily? I certainly did
not, and you say Nora did not. Papa or Tom
could have no reason for touching it. I will
tell you what I think."</p>

<p>"What mamma?" asked Lily, anxiously.</p>

<p>"That you could not have put it away yesterday
when you stopped sewing upon it.
Think a moment, my daughter; can you distinctly
recollect putting it away in your box?"</p>

<p>Lily stood considering one moment; then dismay
and shame gradually overspread her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, mamma, I just believe I did not.
When I was going to put away my petticoat
in the box, I heard papa come in, and I wanted
to know why he had come home so early; so I
thought I would just wait one moment, and put
it away when I had asked him, and I dropped
it on the floor and ran to papa. And you know
he had come to take us to see those pictures,
and I never thought another thing about the
petticoat. I quite forgot I had not put it away
when I told you I had. I will go and look in
the sitting-room where I was sewing yesterday."</p>

<p>But her search proved fruitless, although
she certainly did look thoroughly through
every part of the room. Nora was called, and
took her part, but all in vain; and at last
mamma came. Mrs. Norris rather felt that
she should let Lily be at all the trouble of finding
the petticoat for herself; but the child
seemed so grieved that she could not bear to
punish her in that way. But mamma was not
more successful than her little daughter and
the nurse had been, although in the end every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
servant was questioned, and every room
searched.</p>

<p>"It is very strange. Are you quite sure you
have not seen it, Hannah?" asked Mrs. Norris
of her chambermaid, a rather dull girl, who
had been but a short time in the house. "Have
you seen nothing of the kind lying about in the
sitting-room, or did you not touch Miss Lily's
box?"</p>

<p>"Miss Lily's harnsum box, is it, ma'am?
Sure, and I did see that a sittin' on the floor,
where I thought you'd not be plased to see it
at all at all, so I just lifted it to the table where
I seen it sittin' before; but ne'er a thing I seen
beside it. It wouldn't be Miss Lily's work what
I found the puppy a pullin' round the ary,
ma'am,&mdash;the mischavous baste that he is, my
heart's most broke with him,&mdash;an' I didn't
take heed what it was, but seein' it that dirty,
I just put it in the basket with the siled
clothes."</p>

<p>Away went Lily, Nora after her; and, sure
enough, the latter soon fished out the unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
little petticoat from the soiled-clothes
basket. Now, indeed, Lily was distressed, and
cried bitterly, for the thing was in no state to
be touched until it had been washed. It was
easy to imagine how it had happened. The
puppy, who was growing very mischievous, and
who, like many another young thing, was fond
of a forbidden plaything, had probably found
the petticoat lying where Lily had heedlessly
dropped it upon the floor; and, watching his
opportunity, had dragged it from the room,
down stairs, and out into the back area, where
Hannah had rescued it, happily before it was
torn and chewed to bits, but not before it was
sadly blackened and soiled.</p>

<hr class="chap" style="page-break-after: always;" />

<p>"Now don't you cry, honey Miss Lily, and
I'll just wash it right out for you, and have it
back as clane as a new pin," said the good-natured
Hannah. "If I'd known it yesterday,
sure I'd a done it then; but niver a wurd did I
think of its bein' your work, and it in that
state. Och, what a crathur it is, that botherin'
little baste!" she added, as she went off with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the melancholy looking petticoat in her hand.</p>

<p>"Will she have it washed and dried and
ironed in time for me to finish it before the
children come, mamma?" asked the sobbing
Lily, burying her head in her mother's lap.</p>

<p>"I am afraid not, dear," answered her
mother, with a tender, pitying touch upon the
thoughtless little head which brought so much
trouble upon itself, "so much time has been
lost in hunting for your work, and it is now
nearly eleven o'clock."</p>

<p>"If I'd only gone to my sewing at first as
you advised me, then I'd have found out sooner
what that horrid little old hateful puppy had
done, and Hannah might have washed the petticoat
for me in time," moaned Lily. "I wish
Tom never had the puppy."</p>

<p>"I do not think we must blame the puppy,
my darling," said her mamma. "He only
acted according to his nature; and he found
the skirt, you know, where it should not have
been."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily, "poor little cunning fellow;
it wasn't his fault. It was all horrid old
me, with my putting off that I never shall cure
myself of; no, never, never. It is too mean
that I cannot finish that tiresome petticoat this
morning."</p>

<p>"Happily, dear, the consequences of your
fault are not yet without remedy, and you may
still make up for lost time, unless something
should happen which we do not foresee; but
you have only this one more chance, Lily. Take
care that you do not neglect it, or be tempted
to procrastinate again."</p>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg"
width="50" height="50" alt="M" />
</div><p class="dropcap2"><span class="smcap">Mrs.</span> Norris was right; for although
Hannah did her best, she found it
impossible to have the petticoat dry
enough to iron so that Lily might have some
time to sew upon it before her young friends
arrived.</p>

<p>As soon as she had at all recovered her spirits,
the little girl relieved her mind in some
degree by making frequent rushes to the head
of the back stairs to see if Hannah were coming
with the petticoat; and once she persuaded
her mother to let her go to the laundry that she
might "be encouraged by seeing how much
Hannah had done."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>But she did not receive much encouragement
from the sight of the still dripping garment,
which Hannah had hung before the fire
that it might dry the more quickly. Hannah
took a cheerful view of the subject, saying she
would have it ready very soon, and there was
"lots of time afore Tuesday mornin'." But
Lily was at last learning the folly of believing
in "lots of time" to come; and she shook her
head in a melancholy manner, and bade Hannah
"take a lesson of her misfortunes, and
never procrastinate."</p>

<p>She returned to the nursery in a very low
state of mind, when Nora told her she would
dress her at once if she chose, so that if she
had any time to spare she might employ it on
the skirt when it was dry.</p>

<p>Lily gratefully accepted the offer, but it
proved of no use as far as the petticoat was
concerned, for she had bade her little friends
to "be sure and come by twelve o'clock," and
her mamma having seconded the invitation,
they had been allowed to do so; and soon after
twelve, Maggie, Bessie, Belle, and Mabel arrived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
just as Hannah brought up the petticoat,
fairly smoking from her hot irons, and five
minutes after, the rest of the young party made
their appearance.</p>

<p>The clouds passed from Lily's face and mind
at the sight of all these "sunbeams," and,
consoling herself with the recollection that
after all she still had Monday afternoon, she
was presently as merry and full of spirits as
usual.</p>

<p>Happily not one of the other children
thought of asking her if the petticoat were
finished, so that she was spared the mortification
of confessing that it was not.</p>

<p>It was proposed that they should all amuse
themselves downstairs until the early dinner,
which had been ordered for them at one
o'clock; after which they would go to the
grand play-room in the attic, Maggie having
provided herself with some fresh proverbs and
charades, which they were to play.</p>

<p>"Harry and Fred are coming over this
afternoon, and we want to make a ship in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
lumber-room. You won't mind, will you?"
asked Tom, who was taking his lunch at the
little girls' dinner.</p>

<p>Doubtful looks were exchanged between
some of them. Maggie's looks were not at all
doubtful; her face was one of blank dismay at
the proposal. Playing charades and proverbs
was all very well when there were only those
of her own age to look on; doing it before
these big boys was quite another thing.</p>

<p>"Not if you don't like it, Maggie," said
Tom, noticing her annoyance; "but we
wouldn't disturb you, and anyhow I am sure
you need not mind having us see you. We'll
be busy at the carpenter's bench and tool-chest,
and you need not heed us if we do
see."</p>

<p>"I'm&mdash;I'm afraid you'll&mdash;you'll laugh at
us," hesitated Maggie, coloring.</p>

<p>"If we laugh, it will be with you, not at
you," said Tom. "But never mind; if you
don't like it, we'll keep out of your way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Maggie felt self-reproached, and, like
the generous little girl she was, determined
that her bashfulness should not get the upper
hand of her readiness to oblige.</p>

<p>"I don't mind it so very much," she said;
"at least I'll try not to, and you can come if
the others say so. I suppose you won't take
notice of us if you are building a ship, would
you, Tom?" she added wistfully.</p>

<p>"No one shall disturb or trouble you in
any way, you may believe that," said Tom;
and Maggie knew that he would keep his word,
and so declared her willingness that the
boys should share the privileges of the lumber-room.</p>

<p>Away to the attic scampered the seven pairs
of little feet the moment dinner was over; and
Nora, following, opened the trunks for them,
then left them to their own devices. That is
to say, she brought her sewing, and went to
sit in one of the rooms which opened out of the
great gallery, where she might be within call
if the children needed her, and at hand to
keep them from mischief. That she provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
for her own amusement by leaving the door so
that she could see and hear, none of them,
not even shy Maggie, noticed or cared.</p>

<p>Maggie of course was always chief spirit
and prime manager of these entertainments;
and she now divided the party, taking Belle
and Nellie with herself as performers in the
first charade, and assigning the part of spectators
to Bessie, Lily, Carrie, and Mabel.</p>

<p>The audience speedily accommodated themselves
and their children&mdash;that is their dolls&mdash;with
seats upon the top of the bins, scrambling
thereto by the help of chairs, and amusing
themselves with lively conversation while
waiting.</p>

<p>Maggie and Nellie brought forth from the
store-room a small table and three chairs,
which were suitably placed; Sir Percy was
brought from his place of repose and laid upon
the floor beside them; after which the young
ladies retired again into privacy.</p>

<p>"The charade has begun, and Sir Percy is a
great big dog this time," said Maggie, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
popping out her head once more, and then
withdrawing it.</p>

<p>After some moments she reappeared, this
time gorgeously arrayed in a flowing train,
formed of an old red table-cloth, bordered
with gold, a wreath of artificial flowers on her
head, ribbons of all colors pinned and tied
about her, and an enormous fan in her hand,
with which she fanned herself affectedly,
mincing and prinking as she walked to a chair,
where she seated herself, taking good care to
keep her face turned from Sir Percy, whom
she pretended not to observe. The audience
were spell-bound with interest and the wish
to guess the word.</p>

<p>"Tell your mistress&mdash;er&mdash;that er&mdash;Madam
Jones&mdash;er&mdash;is here&mdash;er," drawled the lady,
addressing an imaginary servant, closing her
eyes as if quite exhausted, and putting on all
the airs and graces conceivable.</p>

<p>Presently entered the hostess, attired with
similar magnificence, but with rather a bluff
and off-hand manner, which contrasted very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
strikingly with that of her visitor. Meanwhile,
from behind the door of the store-room
came a piteous mewing, which soon
attracted the attention of the second lady, who
peered about her in great surprise, and exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>"That must be a cat mewing, and I never
allow a cat in my house, never!"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;er," drawled Mrs. Jones, "it is only
my sweet pussy, my lovely <i>pet</i>, my only donly
<i>pet</i>; such a dear <i>pet</i>, oh, such! Wouldn't you
like to see her, Mrs. Smith?"</p>

<p>"No, oh, no!" cries Mrs. Smith, lifting up
her hands in horror; "I hate cats, and so does
my lovely <i>pet</i>, Bombastes Furioso. Here,
Bomby, Bomby, Bomby, come and speak to
Mrs. Jones, my darling pet."</p>

<p>Upon which Mrs. Jones affected to see for
the first time the great dog Bombastes Furioso,
and to be filled with alarm at the sight.</p>

<p>"Don't call him, pr-r-r-ay, don't!" she cried.
"Is it possible that you like canine dogs, Mrs.
Smith? How can you have such a pet? Here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
kitty, kitty, kitty!"</p>

<p>Hereupon entered Belle on all fours, covered
with a white flossy mat which had been
brought up from the hall for the purpose, and
ran mewing about her mistress.</p>

<p>"I'd rather like canine dogs than canine
cats," wrathfully cries Mrs. Smith; "and,
ma'am, I tell you I won't have cats in my
house! S'cat, s'cat, s'cat!"</p>

<p>"Ma'am," cries Mrs. Jones, indignantly,
"if you turn out my <i>pet</i>, you turn out me, and
I'll never visit you again, ma'am, nor be acquainted
with you any more. I cut you, ma'am,
I cut you!"</p>

<p>"And I cut you, ma'am. Bringing cats in
my house, indeed! Here, Bombastes Furioso,
s-s-s-s!" and the indignant and inhospitable
Mrs. Smith tried to urge her dog to seize Mrs.
Jones' kitty. Bombastes, however, being a
dog of a lazy turn of mind, contented himself
with deep, hoarse growls whenever Mrs. Jones
was speaking. He was silent when it was
necessary for his mistress to speak; and Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Smith found herself obliged to drag her lumbering
pet onwards by his two remaining hoofs&mdash;I
beg his pardon, I should have said paws.</p>

<p>This was the sole objection to the accommodating
Sir Percy, that he was so unwieldy and
cumbersome to move when circumstances required
that he should do so. This being the
case, Mrs. Jones, whose airs and graces were all
put to flight by this attack upon her, had time
to scuttle off with her pet before Bombastes
Furioso had advanced more than a step or two.</p>

<p>This was greeted with shouts of laughter, in
which the performers themselves joined as they
disappeared; and after the applause had subsided,
the four heads on the top of the bins set
themselves to guess the word.</p>

<p>"I think it's affected lady," said Carrie.</p>

<p>"I don't. I think it is cat or dog," said
Lily. "You know this is only the first syllable,
Carrie, so it couldn't be affected lady."</p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure," said Carrie. "Bessie,
what do you think it is?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it is pet," said Bessie. "Did you
not hear how often they said 'pet'? 'Pet'
dog and 'pet' cat?"</p>

<p>"Yes, so they did," said Lily. "Bessie,
you are right. Oh, isn't it fun?"</p>

<p>The performers were not long in making
their preparations for the next syllable; and
the only change in the outward arrangements
was that various bottles, a saw, some chisels,
awls, and other tools were brought out, and
placed upon the table.</p>

<p>"These are doctors' instruments," Maggie
explained before retiring.</p>

<p>Presently she reappeared, buttoned up in an
overcoat which reached to her feet, a man's
hat coming down over her eyes, a cane in her
hand, and bustled round among the bottles.
From this occupation the doctor was roused
by a knock at the door, and there entered two
other overcoated figures, limping and groaning
in a distressful manner.</p>

<p>"We've been in a railroad accident, and all
our bones are broken, doctor," piped one of
the sufferers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>The unfeeling surgeon hustled them each
into a chair, and with great roughness proceeded
to wrap and bandage, tying a great
many knots with much unnecessary vigor, accompanied
with shrieks and groans from his
patients.</p>

<p>"Ow&mdash;ow&mdash;ow, doctor," cried one of them,
as the doctor pulled hard upon a knot in the
handkerchief he was tying on a broken arm,
"you do hurt more than any doctor I ever
knew. You <i>tie</i> so hard."</p>

<p>"Well," growled the doctor, "when you
come to me with two broken arms, and two
broken legs, and a broken back, and your eyes
put out, and your head smashed up, do you
expect to be mended without being hurt?
Here, let me <i>tie</i> your head."</p>

<p>The patients, being well <i>tied</i> up, at last departed,
followed by the doctor; and the audience
unanimously agreed that <i>tie</i> was the
second syllable.</p>

<p>"Pet&mdash;tie," said Bessie. "I just b'lieve
it's petticoat."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"So it is," said Carrie; while Lily, recalled
to the recollection of her unfortunate petticoat,
was struck dumb by what she considered a
remarkable coincidence.</p>

<p>The performance of the third syllable was
not quite as interesting as the other two had
been, the <i>coats</i> which had been worn by the
doctor and his patients being brought out and
beaten with sticks with a great bustle and
fuss, but without a single spoken word. After
this it scarcely needed the performance of
the whole word to establish the fact that it
was petticoat; but, the chairs and table being
removed, it was gone through with by three
young ladies, very much dressed, taking a
walk on a muddy day, and greatly disturbed for
the fate of their petticoats, as they splashed and
waded through imaginary pools and puddles.</p>

<p>"Petticoat! Petticoat! Petticoat!" resounded
from the top of the bins, accompanied
by violent clapping and stamping, and other
tokens of the pleasure which had been afforded
by the representation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the audience came down from their
perch, and resigned it to the late performers,
with whom they were to change parts; at least,
Belle and Nellie were to do so, for Maggie
was, as I have said, the moving spirit, and all
the others played under her orders. She was
the most ingenious in choosing and arranging
the words, and it was believed that no
charade went off well unless she took part in it.</p>

<p>This arrangement only left two spectators,
it is true; but Maggie said she needed all the
others, and no objection was made.</p>

<p>The chairs and table were now brought back
to their old places. After the necessary dressing
up had been done, Bessie appeared with a
handkerchief tied over her sunny curls, a white
apron coming down to her feet, and followed
by Carrie as a servant, bearing dishes. These&mdash;a
doll's dinner set&mdash;were arranged upon
the table with much noise and rattle, the little
landlady bustling about, and calling upon her
maid to make haste.</p>

<p>"For I keep a very good <i>inn</i>, servant," she
said; "but when some people come to <i>inns</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
they make a great fuss, and give a great deal
of trouble; and I heard of a gentleman who is
coming to my <i>inn</i>, and he is very cross, and a
great scolder, so I don't want to give him any
reason to complain, and we must have every
thing very nice in my <i>inn</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, we'll have the <i>inn</i> very fine
for him," answered the maid.</p>

<p>The fears of the landlady were not unfounded,
as it proved; for presently appeared
Sir Percy in the character of a cross old gentleman,
supported and dragged along with
much difficulty by his wife and daughters.
He was attired in a man's hat and great-coat,
the sleeves of the latter coming down some
distance below his&mdash;h'm&mdash;hands; but this
was a convenience, as they could be flapped
about in wild gesticulation, as he stormed and
scolded at the <i>in</i>conveniences of the <i>inn</i>. A
more ill-tempered old gentleman was never
seen; and a hard time did his attendants have
of it. He laid about him in the most ferocious
manner, and was not to be pacified by all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
attentions that were lavished upon him; until
the little landlady declared that "if that old
gentleman was going to stay a great while in
her <i>inn</i>, she would not keep an <i>inn</i> any
longer."</p>

<p>"Inn, inn," was called, not only from the
bins, but also from the other side of the room,
as the old man was at last carried away, still
growling, and wildly slapping the air with his
coat-cuffs.</p>

<p>The children turned, and Sir Percy tumbled
heavily to the floor, as Maggie loosened her
hold of him, struck dumb by the sight of three
pairs of eyes peering above the side of the
staircase.</p>

<p>"Now, that's too bad," cried Lily. "You
boys can just go 'way. You'll laugh at us."</p>

<p>"Indeed, we won't," said Tom. "We came
up just a few moments ago, and we thought
we wouldn't interrupt you by passing through,
but wait until you had finished, and that was
capitally done. But I'm afraid you'll hurt
yourselves with Sir Percy. He is too heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
for you to lug about, and Maggie's toes barely
escaped just now."</p>

<p>"O Tom!" said Lily; "why, half the fun
would be spoiled if we didn't have Sir Percy."</p>

<p>"Well, be careful then," said Tom, as he
passed on with Harry into the store-room.</p>

<p>But Fred lingered.</p>

<p>"I say, Midge," he said, "let a fellow stay
and see the rest of your charade, will you? It's
jolly."</p>

<p>Maggie looked blank, but all she said was,
"O Fred!"</p>

<p>"No, you can't," said Lily, unmindful of the
duties of hospitality in her own attic; "you
just can't, 'cause you'll laugh, and make fun
of us."</p>

<p>"Now come on, Fred, and let them alone,"
called Tom from within the room. "I promised
them they should not be teased if we came
up here."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to tease them," said Fred.
"I want to see the charade, really and truly.
The little chaps do it first-rate, and I like it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Let me stay, girls."</p>

<p>Maggie and Bessie, especially the latter, had
strong objections to being called "chaps," but
Fred never could remember that. However,
they passed it by; and Fred won a rather
reluctant consent to his remaining as a spectator.
He was put upon his good behavior,
and with a run and a jump speedily landed
himself beside Belle and Carrie, where he
kept his word, and conducted himself as a
well-behaved spectator should do.</p>

<p>The next syllable presented a lady writing,
her maid sewing. In rushes a gardener, tree
in hand, represented by a large feather dust-brush;
and with much Irish brogue and great
excitement, accuses the lady's son of cutting
down a young peach-tree. Son denies, and is
believed by his mother, who sternly tells the
gardener that her son has never told a lie, and
whatever he says is "<i>true</i>, <i>true</i>, <i>true</i>."</p>

<p>Gardener declares that "indade, an' he is
thrue; an' if the missis will but make Master
George Washington hould up the hand that's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
behint him, she'll see the hatchet he did it
with."</p>

<p>Mother demands the hatchet, son rebels,
still keeping his hand behind him, but mother,
chasing round and round, presently discovers
it; whereupon she clasps her hands frantically,
cries she thought he was <i>true</i>, falls fainting to
the ground, and is carried off by son, gardener,
and maid.</p>

<p>This new version of an old and familiar
story was received with tremendous applause,
to which Fred's boots added not a little.</p>

<p>Next appeared Sir Percy once more, this
time without any outward adornments. He
was laid upon the floor, and in his mouth was
thrust a pointed stick, bearing a paper, on
which was written in Maggie's largest, roundest
hand, these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"This is a disagreeable smelling dead cat."</p>

<p>About and around the dead cat walked five
young ladies, uttering exclamations of disgust,
wondering where the smell could come from,
but strangely blind to the offensive animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
which lay before them.</p>

<p>"Ow! how horrid!" cried one.</p>

<p>"Ugh! disgusting!" exclaimed another.</p>

<p>"What an awful smell!" said the third.</p>

<p>"Ugh! it's that dead cat!" said the fourth.
"Let's <i>shun</i> it, let's <i>shun</i> it!"</p>

<p>And with loud cries of "<i>Shun</i> it, <i>shun</i>
it," the five young ladies scamper into the
store-room, from which the sound of smothered
laughter had now and then mingled with the
public applause without.</p>

<p>It was not difficult now to guess the word;
nevertheless the whole charade must be played
out before it was even hinted at to the performers.</p>

<p>"In-tru-sion," was carried out by two of the
aforesaid young ladies, who rang violently at
a front-door bell, and were denied admittance
by a dainty, little sunny-haired maid, who
declared that her mistress was very much
engaged.</p>

<p>The visitors persisted in their desire to see
her, and forced their way in, to be fiercely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
attacked by the indignant lady of the mansion,
who was engaged with her lover, Sir Percy,
and who sternly demanded, "Whence this
<i>intrusion</i>?"</p>

<p>"No intrusion at all, ma'am," says one of
the visitors.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>intrusion</i>, ma'am," replies the hostess;
and contradiction followed free and
fast, until stopped by the shouts of "Intrusion!
Intrusion!" from the reserved seats.</p>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-qt.jpg"
width="63" height="50" alt="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap4"><span class="smcap">"That's</span> capital!" exclaimed Fred.
"Give us another, Midge, will
you?"</p>

<p>Fred had conducted himself with such becoming
propriety, and his applause had been
so hearty, that Maggie felt not only quite
reconciled to his presence, but also ready to
indulge him; and she answered,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, I have one more, and it is to be instructive
as well as amusing, Fred, because it
is an historical charade."</p>

<p>"Go ahead!" said Fred, scrambling back
into his seat, which he had left to help carry
Sir Percy into retirement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>The preparations for the first syllable of the
historical charade were very imposing. Two
chairs were placed face to face; upon these
was mounted the table, turned upside down,
with its legs in the air; to one of the legs was
tied a large feather dust-brush,&mdash;the whole
arrangement supposed to represent an oak-tree,
as Maggie explained.</p>

<p>Maggie, Nellie, Lily, and Belle were the performers
on this occasion; and in due time
they all entered, escorting Sir Percy, now in
the character of King Charles, in full kingly
costume, the red table-cloth doing duty for his
robes, and a crown, a "real crown" of tinsel
paper adorning his majesty's brows. He was
held with some difficulty upon his horse,&mdash;another
chair turned down for the purpose,&mdash;and
again Tom's warning voice came from the
store-room.</p>

<p>"You'd better look out with that old hobby.
You'll hurt yourselves some time, lugging him
about that fashion."</p>

<p>But the suggestion was treated with disdain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>An old hobby indeed! King Charles an "old
hobby"!</p>

<p>The horse&mdash;that is, the chair horse&mdash;paused
beneath the tree, and then, relieved of
his burden, galloped off, led by Belle; while the
other three prepared to hoist his cumbersome
majesty into the tree, he not being agile
enough to perform that office for himself.</p>

<p>Maggie had proposed that two of the children
should be his enemies in pursuit; but no
one was willing to take that character.
Staunch little royalists they were, every one,
and not to be reckoned among the persecutors of
the unfortunate king. So this little diversion
from the true historical facts had been permitted
to suit the occasion, all the more readily
as it was feared that it would take the united
strength of the whole four to raise him to the
necessary height. Still Maggie had not been
quite satisfied with such a very great departure
from reality; and, hearing the difficulty as they
worked at the carpenter's bench, Tom and
Harry had good-naturedly offered to take upon
themselves the obnoxious part of the king's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
enemies, and as soon as he was safely hidden
in the tree to rush forth in search of him, and
feign total unconsciousness as they passed beneath
his place of shelter.</p>

<p>This being settled, and Belle, having disposed
of her horse, and returned to give a
hand to the lifting process, the royal fugitive
was, by the united exertions of his four devoted
adherents, raised to his hiding-place.
But he proved too heavy for the slight construction;
and feather duster, chair, and
table toppled over together, carrying King
Charles with them.</p>

<p>Maggie and Lily held fast, one on either
side, but the other two had left their hold.
Fred, seeing the danger, sprang like a shot
from his seat, and his hand but just touched
the old hobby-horse as it rolled over, not soon
enough to prevent its fall, but in time to turn
the heavy thing a little aside. It fell, carrying
Lily back with it; and the two came
together to the floor, jarring the whole house.
Tom and Harry rushed out, not, alas! in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
play in which they had offered to join, but in
sad and alarmed earnest; and Nora flew from
her work.</p>

<p>Tom had Lily in his arms in an instant, but
the poor little girl was a sorry sight. Sir
Percy's head had struck against hers as they
fell together, and blood was already streaming
from an ugly wound just above her temple.
But for Fred's timely touch, which turned the
weight of the hobby-horse a little to one side,
the child's head must have been crushed, and
she killed.</p>

<p>Oh, was not Maggie thankful that she had
allowed her good-nature to triumph over her
fear of being laughed at, and had consented
to let Fred join in their fun!</p>

<p>Ah! the fun and frolic were changed now,&mdash;changed
to distress and alarm. Lily lay half
stunned, gasping and death-like, while the cries
and shrieks of the other children rang through
the house, and speedily brought her mother to
the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>It was indeed a sad ending to the merry afternoon,
and for a few moments the children could
scarcely believe that Lily was not killed, or at
least dying, so white and quiet did she lie.
Never did piteous cry carry more relief to a
mother's heart than that which at last broke
from the pale, trembling lips; for Mrs. Norris
too had feared that her darling was dangerously,
if not fatally injured. It must have
been so indeed but for the care of the kind
Father who had watched over her, and sent
Fred's timely help to turn aside a portion of
the threatening danger.</p>

<p>"Go for the doctor," said Mrs. Norris.</p>

<p>But Fred, with a thoughtfulness which he
sometimes showed, had already asked Tom if
he should not do this, and had started off
with his direction.</p>

<p>The grass never grew beneath Fred's
nimble feet at any time; and now, when he
believed there was need for speed, he almost flew
over the ground, and, happily finding the doctor
at home, brought him back with him at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Lily had been carried downstairs and laid
upon her little bed, where her mother was
doing for her all that she could, though that
was not much, until the doctor came.</p>

<p>A group of frightened and distressed little
faces met the good old physician's eye as he
passed through the hall. He spoke a few
cheering words as he went by, but as he did
not yet know how much Lily was hurt, he did
not put much heart into his young hearers.
Still it was a comfort to know that he had
come, and it always did one good to see Dr.
Banks' kind, helpful face.</p>

<p>Before the doctor arrived, Lily had opened
her eyes, and smiled at her mother with a
bewildered look; but when she saw the blood
which was streaming from the wound in her
head, she was frightened, and began to cry
again.</p>

<p>But the dear old doctor soon quieted her
fears, and those of her anxious mother; and
the good news presently spread through the
house that he did not think her dangerously
hurt. There was a deep, ugly cut on her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
just above the temple, it was true, and her
eye was already swelling and blackening; but
he had no fears that her injuries were serious,
and with some care and quiet she would soon
be well again.</p>

<p>But Lily had had a very merciful escape,
and Maggie could not be sufficiently glad and
thankful that she had been kind and obliging,
and allowed Fred "to come to the charades,"
when she heard every one saying that but for
the thrust from his hand which had turned
aside the weight of the old hobby-horse, the
heavy thing must have crushed the dear little
head of her young playmate.</p>

<p>"It was quite a mountain of mercy out of a
mole-hill of kindness," quaintly said dear Maggie,
as she wiped from her eyes the tears of
joy and gratitude.</p>

<p>Hearing that Lily must be kept quiet, the
thoughtful Harry carried away his sisters, and
all the other little visitors, as soon as they were
assured that there was no cause for alarm,
and saw them all safely to their separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
homes.</p>

<p>Lily lay patient and gentle under the doctor's
handling, as he felt the poor little bruised head,
and tenderly cut away the hair from the wound,
and bound it up; but every now and then she
put up her hand, with a piteous, anxious expression,
to the eye which was swelling and closing
so fast.</p>

<p>"Does it pain you so, darling?" her mother
would ask.</p>

<p>"Not so very much, mamma," she would
answer, "but"&mdash;and here her words always
came to an end.</p>

<p>But when the doctor was through, and the
aching head laid carefully on a soft pillow, the
trouble that was weighing on her mind broke
forth.</p>

<p>"Doctor," she asked wistfully, "is my eye
going out?"</p>

<p>"Going out? No, indeed," answered the
doctor, cheerily. "I rather think it is going
in, my Lily-bud. It is shutting up pretty tight
now, it is true; but we'll take the swelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
down in a day or two, and it will soon be as
useful and bright as ever."</p>

<p>"By Monday, Doctor?" questioned Lily,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Ho, no, indeed, my little woman! You will
not have much use of this peeper for a week or
ten days to come. Even if you could see out
of it, you must keep quite quiet, lie here on the
bed or on the sofa, and be petted and nursed
for a few days, or this little head may give
you some trouble."</p>

<p>Lily looked as if something was giving her
a good deal of trouble now; for as the doctor
spoke, her face grew longer and longer, and
now she burst into tears again, as she sobbed
out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My petticoat! O mamma, my orphan
petticoat!"</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said the doctor, "what is that, I
should like to know? I have heard of a good
many kinds of petticoats, but I never heard of
an orphan petticoat before. But this will not
do, my child. You <i>must</i> lie down and keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
quiet."</p>

<p>"Do not trouble yourself about the petticoat
now, darling," said her mother, gently laying
her back upon the pillow, from which she
had started up in her distress, "I will arrange
that."</p>

<p>"But, mamma," said Lily, piteously, "you
know you said&mdash;you said that you could not
let Nora finish it for me, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh, dear!&mdash;you
couldn't break your word, you know,
and my orphan child won't have any petticoat,
and it was all my old Pro, and so what can I
do? Oh, if I only didn't have Pro! I b'lieve
he's my worst enemy."</p>

<p>"What is all this about petticoats and pro's,
Mrs. Norris?" said the doctor. "Put her
mind at rest if you can, or we shall be having
headache and fever."</p>

<p>"Lily, darling," said her mother, "you must
set your mind at rest about the petticoat. You
certainly cannot finish it now; but I shall not
let the little orphan suffer. By and by I will
see what is best to do, but now you must talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
and think no more about it. Mamma will
arrange it all for you, and you will make yourself
worse if you fret."</p>

<p>"Dear mamma," said Lily, "I should think
you would want to arrange not to have such a
bothering little thing as me for your own little
girl; only I don't s'pose you do. I b'lieve
mammas generally don't."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush, my darling," said her mother,
whose own heart was swelling with gratitude
that a Higher Hand had "arranged" that her
dear "little bothering thing," as Lily called
herself, was not to be taken from her, but that
she was still spared to be the joy of all who
loved her, the "sunbeam" of the home that
would have seemed so dark without her.</p>

<p>Lily obeyed the soothing touch of her mother's
hand, and, confident that she would find
some way to help her out of her trouble, said
no more of the unfinished task. But it was
upon her mind for all that, as was proved
when the evening wore away, and the fever
and light-headedness the doctor had feared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
came on. A very slight illness was enough to
make Lily light-headed, and the blow she had
received was by no means a slight one. So it
was not strange that it should have that effect.
And she talked pretty wildly about petticoats
and puppies, work-boxes and rocking-horses,
and had many bitter words for her enemy Pro;
and all her mother could say would not soothe
her.</p>

<p>But at last she grew more quiet, and the
poor little bruised head ceased to wander, and
she fell asleep; and when she awoke in the
morning, her mind was as bright and clear as
ever.</p>

<p>But her face was sadly disfigured, and one
eye was quite closed up, so that it was plainly
to be seen that Lily would not have much use
of it for some days to come. All this would
pass away in time, however; swelling and discoloration
would disappear by and by; and,
happily, the cut upon her head came where
the scar would be hidden by her hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhat to Mrs. Norris' surprise, Lily said
no word of the petticoat all the next day; but
she was very glad that it was so, and took
pains to avoid any thing that might turn her
thoughts that way. Lily did think of it, however,
although she said nothing; and she
could not but wonder now and then how
her mother would contrive to help her without
breaking her word. But she felt languid and
ill, and it was a trouble to talk, so she let it go
for the present, believing as usual that it
would come right somehow.</p>

<p>But on Monday morning, when Nora was
dressing her, the nurse said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Miss Lily, darling, I am just going to ask
your mamma to let me finish your petticoat for
you. I think she'll excuse you this once, since
you cannot do it for yourself."</p>

<p>"No," said Lily earnestly, "you must not
ask mamma, Nora, 'cause it would only give
her the uncomfortableness of saying no. She
told me she would not let the little orphan
suffer for my fault, and she will find a way to
make it right, though I don't know what it is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
and I am too ashamed to ask her. But you
know she said very surely and pos-i-tive-ly,
Nora, that she would not let you finish it,
if it was not done through my putting off;
and that was the reason it was not done on
Saturday morning, as it ought to have been.
I know I cannot do it now myself, but I
could have done it before; and mamma can
not break her word."</p>

<p>Lily concluded with a sigh, for she really
did not know what plan her mother could have
for helping her, and she was very anxious,
though, as she said, too much ashamed to ask
any more.</p>

<p>But it so happened that Mrs. Norris overheard
this conversation, and she was thankful
to find how strong in her Lily was that sense
of truth which would not allow her to believe
for one moment that mamma could go back
from her word under any circumstances. It
was rather remarkable that with all her heedlessness
and volatile spirits, Lily was so strictly
truthful and upright, for they never betrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
her into an equivocation, as carelessness and
want of thought are too apt to do.</p>

<p>The morning was not far gone before Lily's
mind was set at rest on the subject of her
petticoat, for her mamma came to sit beside
her, and brought her work with her.</p>

<p>And what was her work?</p>

<p>Lily noticed it in a moment; a petticoat for
a child,&mdash;not of such muslin as her own skirts,
but coarser and stronger, just such as her
"orphan petticoat" was made of.</p>

<p>"Mamma?" she said, with her eyes fixed
upon the strips of muslin in her mother's hand.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," said her mother, "you know I
said the little orphan must not suffer through
you, and I told you Nora could not finish your
petticoat, and send it as your work, if you did
not do it yourself; so I shall make this one, and
send it to Miss Ashton in the place of the other."</p>

<p>"And tell Miss Ashton, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, dear, I must. Do you not think
so?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, and I s'pose the girls must
know. Even if she don't tell them, I think I
ought to when I go back to school. They
ought not to think I was industrious and good
like the rest when I just put off and put off
until this sad accident came, and then I really
couldn't do it;" and here a great tear rolled
down Lily's cheek.</p>

<p>"My darling," said her mother, dropping
her work, and bending over to kiss the sorrowful
little face, "mamma cannot bear to see
you mortified and grieved, but she does want
this to be a lesson to you, and to save you
from future trouble and loss."</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma, I know," answered Lily,
"and it serves me quite right; but it does
make me feel very badly to know that all the
other children can feel that the little orphans
are having some good of their kindness, and
they do not have one bit of mine."</p>

<p>Mrs. Norris hesitated before she spoke again.
She felt as if she could not bear to have her
poor child so hardly punished now when she
was suffering, and had just escaped such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
great danger. She could not let Nora finish
the petticoat, but why not finish it herself, she
thought, as well as make another, and send it
to Miss Ashton with a message from Lily that
she had not done the whole of it herself?</p>

<p>Just then came a knock at the door, and,
being bidden to enter, Robert brought a note
for Miss Lily, saying the messenger waited
for an answer.</p>

<p>"It is Maggie's writing, I think," said Mrs.
Norris.</p>

<p>Lily raised herself, and held out her hand.</p>

<p>"You cannot read it for yourself, dear.
Shall I do it?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>Lily assented, and, opening the note, Mrs.
Norris read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear Lily</span>,&mdash;We are so sorry for you, all
of us, but we are so very happy you were not
killed by Sir Percy Hotspur, who is very nice
to play with, but not nice to fall underneath,
and we are glad you are not such a victim as
that. But, Lily, dear, we do not know, Bessie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and I, if you have finished your petticoat for the
orphan child. We did not ask you on Saturday
because we thought if it was not done you
wouldn't like to say so, but we thought
perhaps the reason you did not speak about it
was because a 'burnt child dreads the fire,'
which means people don't like things that
bring them into trouble, or to speak about
them. So we thought it was quite probable
that it was not done, and we know you cannot
finish it now, for yesterday we met Dr. Banks
when we were coming from church, and he
said you could not go to school, or use your
poor hurt eye for a good many days. So, dear,
if you would let me finish it for you, I would
be very glad, and Bessie will too, and you can
send it to me by Patrick. And you need not
think I will have to do it all in my play-time,
for mamma says I can do it in my sewing-lesson
to-day, which is half an hour, and if
there is any more, I'd just as lieve do it afterwards,
and the heart which would not do that
is not worthy of a friend, but ought to be like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
a man we read about the other day who lived in
a tub and was cross to everybody. And do you
believe, people called him a wise man!!!
Which shows they must have been very stupid
people in those days to call such an old cross-patch
wise, and I'm glad I was never acquainted
with him for I would not consider him fit to
know.</p>

<p>"So ask your mamma to send me the petticoat
if it is not done, that my true friendship may
have the pleasure of finishing it. From your
esteemed friend,</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1em; text-align: right;">
"<span class="smcap">Maggie Stanton Bradford</span>.
</p>

<p>"P.S. If a pretty bad button-hole would be
any relief to your feelings instead of strings, I
would just as lieve make one, but it don't look
very nice."</p></blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">To have seen Lily's eyes&mdash;or rather her eye,
for you know there was only one to be seen&mdash;as
her mother finished reading this letter to
her! to have seen the pleading of her poor
little face!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, dear," said her mother, smiling back
in answer to the unspoken question that was
written in every line of her Lily's countenance.
"Well, dear, shall we accept Maggie's offer?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma! if you think I might," cried
Lily.</p>

<p>"Yes," said her mother, "since dear Maggie
is so good as to offer, and give up her time to
you, perhaps I will let you accept. But, my
darling, I do not want you to forget that here
again the consequences of your habit of procrastinating
are falling on another. Maggie is
doing the work which should have been done
by you, and although, I am sure she does it
willingly, and with all her heart, dear little
friend that she is, still you must own that it
is hard she should have her own share, and
part of yours too."</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," answered Lily, penitently,
"and I know I don't deserve to have any of
the work I have done go to the orphan that has
no father or mother, and I am very thankful
to darling Maggie. And, mamma, I think
I ought to ask you to write a note to Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Ashton, and let her tell the other children that
I did not do the whole of the petticoat, or it
would not be quite fair. 'Specially, mamma,
'cause some of them said I wouldn't have my
petticoat done, and I <i>scorned</i> what they said,
and was very sure of myself. So it would be
more true, I think, to tell them how it was."</p>

<p>"Yes, darling," said her mother, glad that
her little girl was so truthful, and unwilling
to take any credit that was not rightly her
own; and then she kissed her, and, bringing
the unfortunate petticoat, rolled it up, and
sent it away to the dear little sunbeam who
was so ready to shed light and comfort
wherever she had the power to do so.</p>

<div><img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t.jpg"
width="51" height="50" alt="T" />
</div><p class="dropcap2"><span class="smcap">There</span> was a good deal of bustle and
excitement, as you may imagine, on
Tuesday morning, when Miss Ashton's
little scholars came, each with her respective
parcel.</p>

<p>Poor Lily of course was not there; it
would be many a day yet before she was able
to come to school, but all the others were in
their places, and very anxious for the lessons
to be over. Nor were Maggie and Bessie
there during school-hours; but they were to
come afterwards, and bring the little garments
they had made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let's see who finished her work first,"
said Gracie. "Dora, when did you finish
yours?"</p>

<p>"Saturday morning," answered Dora.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Gracie, "how long you were.
Nellie, when was yours done?"</p>

<p>"Last night," answered Nellie; "and I was
very glad I had not taken a petticoat, for I
could not have finished it."</p>

<p>Gracie only looked her contempt, but she
did that so plainly that it might have placed
her in the ranks of the anti-politers quite as
readily as rude and scornful words could have
done. Nellie felt it, colored, and looked hurt.</p>

<p>"Belle, when did you finish yours?"</p>

<p>"I <i>perfer</i> not to tell you," answered Belle,
with magnificence.</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Gracie.</p>

<p>"If your guilty conscience don't tell you,
it's no use for me to speak about it," replied
Belle, with well-deserved severity, supposed
to be kept within the bounds of courteousness.</p>

<p>Gracie gave her head a little toss, as much
as to say that Belle's opinion was quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
beneath her notice; but that her "guilty conscience"
did accuse her was to be seen from
the fact that she questioned no more of her
classmates, but said conceitedly,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I finished my petticoat the very Saturday
after I took it;" and then looked about her
for the applause which no one had the mind
to offer.</p>

<p>It was strange that the frequency of the
disappointments of this nature which she
received did not teach Gracie that those who
sought the most eagerly for food for their own
vanity were not the most apt to receive it;
but her insatiable self-conceit needed some
severe teaching before it would lose its hold
of her, and such slight blows as these were
without much effect on the still increasing
evil.</p>

<p>"I am sure I could easily have made two if
I had chosen," continued Gracie. "It is
nothing so very great to make a petticoat in a
week."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," said Nellie, who seldom
bore malice, "I think it is pretty well for little
girls to make one in two weeks. I am slow,
I know, but as Lily said,&mdash;poor dear Lily,&mdash;I
am a steady tortoise after all, and have done
my task in time."</p>

<p>"Is Lily's petticoat finished?" asked Mabel.
"Does any one know?"</p>

<p>No, no one knew; but more than one
thought it quite likely that Lily would be
behindhand. They knew her ways well. But,
before they had time for much more conversation
on the subject, Miss Ashton came in, and
the business of the day began.</p>

<p>Twelve o'clock came, bringing with it
Maggie and Bessie, who also brought each
the little garment she had completed; and,
school being at an end, the children gathered
about Miss Ashton to have her verdict on
their work.</p>

<p>Belle's bag was the first to be examined,
and Miss Ashton pronounced it very well done
for a little girl who was but just learning to
sew. There were some long and crooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
stitches, it is true; but they were tight and
close, and showed that she had taken great
pains. So did Bessie's; and Mabel's also
was considered a success. Carrie Ransom's
did not show quite as much care, but it would
pass. So much for the bags made by the four
lesser children; and now Miss Ashton turned
to the petticoats.</p>

<p>"I have here a note from Lily," she said,
"which I shall read first. She sent it to me
this morning, with her work, and a request
that I would tell you what it contained."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Gracie, "I suppose she has not
finished her petticoat. She never does things
when she ought to, and she is always behindhand.
I finished my petticoat on the first
Saturday, Miss Ashton."</p>

<p>Now, would you not have thought that
Gracie disliked Lily, and was glad to have
the chance of showing up her faults? But it
was not really so; for if you had asked Gracie,
she would have told you that she was fond of
Lily, and thought her on the whole a very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
little girl. But Gracie's habit of comparing
herself with others to their disadvantage gave
her, not only the appearance of great conceit,
but also of constant fault-finding with her
companions.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton took no notice of her speech,
but opened the envelope, and took out the
note, which Mrs. Norris had written at Lily's
dictation.</p>

<p>"Miss Ashton," repeated Gracie, "I finished
my petticoat Saturday before last, every stitch
of it."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Miss Ashton, coolly, and
without farther attention, read aloud:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Ashton</span>,&mdash;I think I ought to
tell you that I did not do all my petticoat myself,
and it was not all because of my hurting
myself, but because I did not do it in good
time, but put off until I had left a good task
for the last day, when my eye was so hurt I
could not sew. But dear Maggie had her's all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
done, and so she had time for a kindness, and
she finished mine; but I thought I ought to
do myself the mortification of telling you
about it, for fear you and the other children
should give me praise I did not deserve.</p>

<p>"And now I am very sorry I was so sure of
myself to be so certain I would not fall into
my bad habit again, which I find is not cured,
as I said it was; but I have to try very hard
yet. And I know the other children will
think I thought myself very great, and I am
ashamed of it, and of my procrastination too,
dear Miss Ashton, which you told me would
give me great trouble, and mamma too, and I
see it. So please excuse me, and my eye and
my head are better, thank you; but the doctor
says I cannot use my eye for a good many
days, and my head aches some yet.</p>

<p>"Please give my love to all the children, and
tell them to come and see me.</p>

<p>"From your affectionate little scholar,</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 2em; text-align: right;">"<span class="smcap">Lily Norris</span>."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>If Lily's schoolmates did imagine that she
thought herself "great," not one of them said
so; and the reading of her letter was followed
by many expressions of affection and sympathy,
mingled with admiration for her straightforward
honesty, which would not let her
receive credit which was not her due.</p>

<p>However, when Miss Ashton unfolded the
petticoat sent by Lily, and examined the sewing,
it was found that, wanting though she might
have been in punctuality and industry, Lily certainly
deserved praise for the manner in which
her work was done. It was extremely neat
and even for such a little girl; and both her
own share, and that completed by Maggie
Bradford received much approbation from Miss
Ashton.</p>

<p>Maggie's petticoat merited a like meed of
compliment, and Nellie Ransom's apron,
which came next, was pronounced remarkably
well done.</p>

<p>"Why, Nellie, my dear," said Miss Ashton,
looking with surprise at the neatly laid gathers,
even hems, and regular stitches, "is it possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
that you did this all yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," answered steady, painstaking
Nellie, who, although she was perhaps less
quick than any of her schoolmates, was seldom
or never behind the rest, for the reason that
she was so industrious and earnest,&mdash;"yes,
ma'am. An apron was not very much for me
to do, but I wanted to be sure and have it
nicely done."</p>

<p>"And, indeed, you have," said Miss Ashton,
still examining the apron with pleasure. "I
must give you the credit, Nellie, of saying that
I never saw a piece of work better done by
any child of your age. I do not know that I
I would have done it as well myself."</p>

<p>"Mamma takes great pains to teach me to
sew nicely," said Nellie, dimpling and flushing
with pleasure at her teacher's praise.</p>

<p>"And you must have taken great pains to
learn, my dear," said Miss Ashton, laying her
hand on that of the modest little girl.</p>

<p>Two or three others received their share of
praise, some more, some less, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
their merits, though all were fairly done; and
then Miss Ashton came to Gracie's petticoat.</p>

<p>That it gave her far less satisfaction than the
rest of the little garments had done, was
plainly to be seen by her countenance, as she
examined it.</p>

<p>"Why, Gracie, my dear," she said, "is it
possible that you can sew no better than this?
No, it is not; for I have seen your work before,
and know that you can do better if you choose.
Why, Gracie, the stitches are not half as neat
as those of the very little girls, and this band
will not hold at all. It is impossible for me to
give in such work as this. See here;" and as
she drew the stitches slightly apart, with not
half the strain that would come upon them in
the wearing, they parted and ripped, showing
with what extreme carelessness the work had
been done.</p>

<p>I do not think Miss Ashton would have said
as much to any other one of her little scholars;
but she thought that this mortification and
blow to her self-conceit would do Gracie no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
harm.</p>

<p>"My dear," she continued, "you have not
taken time enough to do your work properly.
Another time, better less haste and more care,
Gracie. I shall have to take out almost the
whole of this, and do it over myself, for I
should be ashamed that our little orphans
should have the example of such work. Your
mother was away, I know, so that you could
not go to her for help; but could you not ask
some other person to show you how it should
be done?"</p>

<p>"I should think I might know how to make
a petticoat," said Gracie, rather saucily.</p>

<p>"It seems you do not," replied Miss Ashton,
gravely. "As I must do this over, you cannot
expect that it should be given in as your
work, Gracie."</p>

<p>Gracie tossed her head, and looked very
angry, muttering, she "did not care," then
burst into tears, saying it was "too bad," and
"real mean," and she knew "it was just as
good as the rest, only Miss Ashton never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
would think she did any thing fit to be seen,"
and altogether allowed her temper and
wounded vanity so far to get the better of
her that Miss Ashton bade her leave the room.</p>

<p>I am glad to say, however, that a few moments'
solitude and reflection in the cloak-room
brought her to her right senses; and before
she went home, she returned to her teacher,
and begged her pardon for the temper and
disrespect she had shown.</p>

<p>"But my work was finished long before any
of the other children's, Miss Ashton," she said
once more, after the lady had assured her
she was forgiven, giving her at the same time
a gentle, and, alas! too oft-repeated warning
against the hold her besetting sin was gaining
on her temper and character.</p>

<p>Miss Ashton shook her head.</p>

<p>"But it is all thrown away, and worse than
thrown away, Gracie," she said, "for it will
need more time for me to take it to pieces and
do it over again than it would have taken to
make it myself at once. I can give you no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
credit, my child, for striving to outstrip your
schoolmates, merely that you might have the
pleasure of saying that you had done so. You
are severe with Lily for her want of punctuality
and promptness; but too great haste,
especially when it springs from a bad motive,
is perhaps as bad. And, Gracie, Lily sees and
acknowledges her fault, while you will not."</p>

<p>Gracie hung her head, but she was none the
more convinced; and, in spite of her confession,
went home, thinking herself hardly used, and
Miss Ashton very unjust.</p>

<p>With the exception of Gracie, there was
not one of the little work-women whose sewing
was not at least passable, and her garment
tolerably well made; and they were dismissed,
well satisfied with the praise they received, and
the knowledge that their own self-denial and
effort had helped those who were in need.</p>

<p>Mrs. Norris had begged that Maggie and
Bessie would come and see Lily that afternoon,
as she was now well enough to receive them,
and tell her all that had taken place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
morning; and accordingly they presented
themselves in Lily's room, bringing with them
their dolls.</p>

<p>"My dollies haven't had their dresses
changed since Saturday, before I was hurt,"
said Lily, at the sight of the last-mentioned
young ladies. "Will you dress them for me
while you tell me about this morning?"</p>

<p>Dolls and dolls' clothes were brought forth,
Lily possessing a multitude of both; and the
two little sisters fell to dressing the neglected
children of an invalid mamma.</p>

<p>"It wasn't putting off this time," said Lily,
apologetically, "for I really did seem to be so
tired every time I tried to do any thing, even
play, that mamma told me I had better lie
still."</p>

<p>"Yes, we know," said Bessie, "and even if
it was procrastination, dolls don't really suffer,
so I s'pose it's not much harm to put off doing
things for them. It don't hurt," she added
thoughtfully, as she drew a comb about three
inches long through the flowing locks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
waxen Georgianna upon her lap,&mdash;"it don't
hurt to put off play and pleasure, I believe, but
only duties, and things that will do good to
others."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lily, rather ruefully, as if she
wished that pleasures and duties might alike
fall under the same head, "so I find most
people think. The trouble of it, and what
makes it so hard is, that when a duty and a
pleasure both come at once, it 'most always
seems right to take the duty first; and I like
pleasure so much better than duty that I
expect that's the reason I procrastinate so
often."</p>

<p>"I believe that's the case with most people,"
said Maggie, putting on her wisdom cap to
suit the solemnity of the conversation. "I find
the human race generally like pleasure better
than duty, 'specially if the duty is very
disagreeable, and the pleasure is very nice."</p>

<p>"That's the way with me, anyhow," said
Lily, with a sigh, as she lay back upon her sofa
pillows once more. "And sometimes, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
when the duty is not very disagreeable, I feel
like putting it off, just because I know I ought
to do it, I believe. That petticoat was not so
very horrid to do, and yet I let every thing put
me away from doing it, till at last you know
the consequence."</p>

<p>"Miss Ashton praised your petticoat very
much, anyhow," said Maggie. "She said you
had done the most of it, and it was all
<i>well</i> done."</p>

<p>"She praised Maggie's part too," said Bessie,
unwilling that her sister should not receive her
full share of credit, "and she said the button-hole
was even better than that on Maggie's
own petticoat."</p>

<p>"Practice makes perfect, you know," said
Maggie. "Miss Ashton said not one piece of
work was better made than that petticoat,
except Nellie's apron, and that was the best of
all. Miss Ashton seemed quite surprised at it,
it was so very nice. And I don't mean to tell
tales about Gracie, but you would hear about
it, I suppose, when you go back to school, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
we may as well tell you, 'cause you want to
know about every thing."</p>

<p>And between them, first one taking up the
tale, and then the other, Lily had soon heard
a full and particular account of all the occurrences
of the morning.</p>

<p>"And did not any one say hateful things
about me when Miss Ashton read my letter,
and they knew I had not done what I was so
sure I would do?" asked Lily.</p>

<p>"No indeed," said Bessie. "We wouldn't
have listened to them if they had wanted to;
but then no one would say an unkind thing
about you when you were so honest and true,
Lily. They were only sorry for you, and didn't
seem to think you were naughty one bit."</p>

<p>"But I was," said Lily, "and I'm never
going to boast myself again, for I do feel too
ashamed when I think how sure I was
that I would do so much. I don't believe I
ever will cure myself of procrastination, do
you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, yes," answered Bessie, "if you try
enough."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I did try," said Lily, "but it was
no use. If I did not forget so easily, I
think I would not have so much trouble from
procrastination; but, you see, sometimes I leave
a thing just for one moment, at least I mean
to come back in a moment, and then I never
think any thing more about it. That was the
way the puppy found my petticoat lying on the
floor, and dragged it about till it had to be
washed before I could sew on it, and then it
was too late."</p>

<p>"I used to be just as careless as that," said
Maggie; "and though mamma says I have
improved a great deal, and am pretty neat and
careful now, yet I find it hard work still,
and I have to make a rule for myself not to
leave a thing one moment after I know I ought
to do it, or else I am almost sure to forget.
I don't always keep that rule yet," she added,
rather remorsefully, "but it helps me, and
makes me better than I used to be."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that what cured you of carelessness?
for I don't think you are much careless now,"
said Lily.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie, slowly, "that&mdash;and&mdash;and"&mdash;here
she fell into a sudden fit of
bashfulness at her own confession, and Bessie
had to help her out of it.</p>

<p>"Partly that, and partly because she asked
Jesus to help her," said the little sister.
"And He did, 'cause He always does if we
really and truly ask Him. Did you ever ask
Him to help you, Lily?"</p>

<p>"What, about putting off?" said Lily.
"Why, no, I never thought much about it&mdash;and&mdash;besides&mdash;it
seems such a queer thing
to pray about, and to ask Jesus to help you in.
It is not a sin, you know. It does make me
sin sometimes," she added, thoughtfully, as
she recalled various naughtinesses into which
her sad habit had led her. "Oh, if you knew
something it had made me do, you would think
I was too horrid!" She was thinking of the
way in which she had spoken to her mother
but a few days since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, then," said Bessie, tenderly, "isn't
that a reason for asking Him? I don't b'lieve
Jesus thinks any thing is no matter if it makes
us do something that is wrong, and I don't
b'lieve He thinks even a bad habit is a little
thing, and I'm sure He'll help you if you only
ask Him."</p>

<p>"Sometimes when I was praying, I have
thought maybe I had better ask Jesus not to
let me put off," said Lily, "but I did not think
<i>much</i> about it, and it hardly seemed worth
while, and I generally thought I could do
it some other time."</p>

<p>Lily said these last words in rather a shamefaced
manner, as if she were mortified to
recollect and confess that she had allowed her
failing to come even between her and the
Great Helper.</p>

<p>"But you will ask Him now, won't you?"
asked Bessie anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will," said Lily earnestly, and as
if she really meant it; and I am glad to say
that she kept her resolution, and "put off"
no longer asking the help which could not, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
would not fail her. And receiving what she
sought, as all shall do who seek it in truth,
and in the right spirit, and continuing also to
strive with the temptation of the moment
which bids her postpone the duty before her,
our Lily is gaining the victory over the enemy
which brought her into so much trouble, and
had more than once led her so far astray.</p>
